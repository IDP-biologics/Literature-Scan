      "There is a global concern and increasing reports regarding foodborne disease infections associated with consuming contaminated vegetables, seafood, meat, and poultry products. Among foodborne bacterial pathogens globally, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Shigella were the most frequently implicated in causing food poisoning infections in children and adults. In Saudi Arabia, the consumption rates of imported fresh fruits, vegetables, seafood, and meat products are considered high. Therefore, the development of simple PCR based DNA fingerprinting methods is essential to track the source and route of microbial contamination among imported frozen meat and seafood products. A total of 38 E. coli strains were subtyped using ERIC1R, ERIC2, and a pair combination (ERIC1R + ERIC2) to generate genomic fingerprinting. The three Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus-Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR)-based primers were generated in 26, 24, and 16 different genotypes while using ERIC1R, ERIC2, and ERIC1R + ERIC2, respectively. The Discrimination Index values obtained by ERIC1R, ERIC2, and ERIC1R + ERIC2 were 0.976, 0.965, and 0.903, respectively. ERIC1R and ERIC2 primers had the best discriminatory ability and typeability value and proved suitable for investigating genetic analysis among the population of E. coli strains. At the same time, the ERIC1R + ERIC2 primer pair has average discriminatory power and typeability value for differentiating E. coli strains. These results suggest that subtyping using ERIC1R and ERIC2 primer is a more reliable and rapid typing strategy for E. coli strains.\n",

      "Transfer learning aims at enhancing machine learning performance on a problem by reusing labeled data originally designed for a related, but distinct problem. In particular, domain adaptation consists for a specific task, in reusing training data developedfor the same task but a distinct domain. This is particularly relevant to the applications of deep learning in Natural Language Processing, because they usually require large annotated corpora that may not exist for the targeted domain, but exist for side domains. In this paper, we experiment with transfer learning for the task of relation extraction from biomedical texts, using the TreeLSTM model. We empirically show the impact of TreeLSTM alone and with domain adaptation by obtaining better performances than the state of the art on two biomedical relation extraction tasks and equal performances for two others, for which little annotated data are available. Furthermore, we propose an analysis of the role that syntactic features may play in transfer learning for relation extraction. Given the difficulty to manually annotate corpora in the biomedical domain, the proposed transfer learning method offers a promising alternative to achieve good relation extraction performances for domains associated with scarce resources. Also, our analysis illustrates the importance that syntax plays in transfer learning, underlying the importance in this domain to privilege approaches that embed syntactic features.\n",

      "Biological ontologies are continually growing and improving from requests for new classes (terms) by biocurators. These ontology requests can frequently create bottlenecks in the biocuration process, as ontology developers struggle to keep up, while manually processing these requests and create classes. TermGenie allows biocurators to generate new classes based on formally specified design patterns or templates. The system is web-based and can be accessed by any authorized curator through a web browser. Automated rules and reasoning engines are used to ensure validity, uniqueness and relationship to pre-existing classes. In the last 4 years the Gene Ontology TermGenie generated 4715 new classes, about 51.4% of all new classes created. The immediate generation of permanent identifiers proved not to be an issue with only 70 (1.4%) obsoleted classes. TermGenie is a web-based class-generation system that complements traditional ontology development tools. All classes added through pre-defined templates are guaranteed to have OWL equivalence axioms that are used for automatic classification and in some cases inter-ontology linkage. At the same time, the system is simple and intuitive and can be used by most biocurators without extensive training.\n",

      "Mitigating climate change requires fundamentally redesigned energy systems in which renewable energy sources ultimately replace fossil fuels such as natural gas. In this context, the question how and to which extent the gas sector can contribute to an increasingly climate-neutral future EU energy system is heavily debated among scholars, energy industry experts, and policy makers. We take a two-step approach: we begin with a review of studies from energy industry and academia to discuss potential gas sector contributions from a holistic energy system design point of view; this is followed by a comprehensive discussion of technical potentials, micro-economic conditions, and societal implications of renewable gas. We then enrich our findings with the results of an empirical focus group process. The gas sector can not only contribute to balancing volatile renewable energy production but also enable the supply of renewable energy to end-users in gaseous form; based on existing infrastructure. This could reduce costs for society, increase public acceptance, and ultimately speed up the energy system transformation. There is the theoretical technical potential to substitute major parts of natural gas with renewable gas of biogenic and synthetic nature. This, however, crucially requires a supportive policy framework like the one established for renewable electricity. Given the societal benefits and the competitiveness of renewable gas as compared to renewable alternatives, energy policy makers should incorporate renewable gas and the existing gas infrastructure in the future energy system framework. The objective should be an optimized interplay of various energy vectors and their infrastructure along the entire energy supply chain. This requires a level playing field for different renewable technologies across different policy areas and a form of public support that strikes the balance between facilitating the gradual substitution of natural gas by renewable gas while maintaining public acceptance for this transformation despite higher costs for end-users.\n",

      "Reconstruction of severe osteochondral defects in articular cartilage and subchondral trabecular bone remains a challenging problem. The well-integrated bilayer osteochondral graft design expects to be guided the chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation for stem cells and provides a promising solution for osteochondral tissue repair in this study. The subchondral bone scaffold approach is based on the developed finer and denser 3D β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) bioceramic scaffold process, which is made using a digital light processing (DLP) technology and the novel photocurable negative thermo-responsive (NTR) bioceramic slurry. Then, the concave-top disc sintered 3D-printed bioceramic incorporates the human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) laden photo-cured hybrid biohydrogel (HG + 0.5AFnSi) comprised of hyaluronic acid methacryloyl (HAMA), gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), and 0.5% (w/v) acrylate-functionalized nano-silica (AFnSi) crosslinker. The 3D β-TCP bioceramic compartment is used to provide essential mechanical support for cartilage regeneration in the long term and slow biodegradation. However, the apparent density and compressive strength of the 3D β-TCP bioceramics can be obtained for ~ 94.8% theoretical density and 11.38 ± 1.72 MPa, respectively. In addition, the in vivo results demonstrated that the hADSC + HG + 0.5AFnSi/3D β-TCP of the bilayer osteochondral graft showed a much better osteochondral defect repair outcome in a rabbit model. The other word, the subchondral bone scaffold of 3D β-TCP bioceramic could accelerate the bone formation and integration with the adjacent host cancellous tissue at 12 weeks after surgery. And then, a thicker cartilage layer with a smooth surface and uniformly aligned chondrocytes were observed by providing enough steady mechanical support of the 3D β-TCP bioceramic scaffold.\n",

      "Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) offer promising methods for disinfection by generating radical species like hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anion radicals, and hydroxy peroxyl, which can induce oxidative stress and deactivate bacterial cells. Photocatalysis, a subset of AOPs, activates a semiconductor using specific electromagnetic wavelengths. A novel material, Cu/Cu2O/CuO nanoparticles (NPs), was synthesized via a laser ablation protocol (using a 1064 nm wavelength laser with water as a solvent, with energy ranges of 25, 50, and 80 mJ for 10 min). The target was sintered from 100 °C to 800 °C at rates of 1.6, 1.1, and 1 °C/min. The composite phases of Cu, CuO, and Cu2O showed enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible-light excitation at 368 nm. The size of Cu/Cu2O/CuO NPs facilitates penetration into microorganisms, thereby improving the disinfection effect. This study contributes to synthesizing mixed copper oxides and exploring their activation as photocatalysts for cleaner surfaces. The electronic and electrochemical properties have potential applications in other fields, such as capacitor materials. The laser ablation method allowed for modification of the band gap absorption and enhancement of the catalytic properties in Cu/Cu2O/CuO NPs compared to precursors. The disinfection of E. coli with Cu/Cu2O/CuO systems serves as a case study demonstrating the methodology’s versatility for various applications, including disinfection against different microorganisms, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative.\n",

      "Separation processes aimed at recovering the solvent from effluent streams offer a means for establishing a circular economy. Conventional technologies such as distillation are energy-intensive, inefficient and suffer from high operating and maintenance costs. Pervaporation based membrane separation overcomes these challenges and in conjunction with the utilization of inorganic membranes derived from non-toxic, sufficiently abundant and hence expendable, silica, allows for high operating temperatures and enhanced chemical and structural integrity. Membrane-based separation is predicted to dominate the industry in the coming decades, as the process is being understood at a deeper level, leading to the fabrication of tailored membranes for niche applications. The current review aims to compile and present the extensive and often dispersive scientific investigations to the reader and highlight the current scenario as well as the limitations suffered by this mature field. In addition, viable alternative to the conventional methodologies, as well as other rival materials in existence to achieve membrane-based pervaporation are highlighted.\n",

      "The output power of PV systems is influenced by various factors, resulting in strong volatility and randomness, which makes it difficult to forecast. Therefore, this paper proposes an Informer prediction model based on optimised VMD for predicting short-term PV power. Firstly, the temporal coding of the Informer model is improved and, secondly, the original sequence is decomposed into multiple modal components using VMD, and then optimisation of the results of VMD in conjunction with the optimisation strategy of SSA improves the characteristics of the time series data. Finally, the refined data are fed into the Informer framework for modelling and prediction, utilising the self-attention mechanism and multiscale feature fusion of Informer to precisely forecast PV power. The power of PV prediction data from the SSA-VMD-Informer model and four other commonly used models is compared. Experimental results indicate that the SSA-VMD-Informer model performs exceptionally well in short-term PV power prediction, achieving higher accuracy than traditional methods. As an example, the results of predicting the PV power on 24 April in a region of Xinjiang are 1.3882 for RMSE, 0.8310 for MSE, 1.14 for SDE, and 0.9944 for R2.\n",

      "In this study, Ni35Co35Cr12.6Al7.5Ti5Mo1.68W1.39Nb0.95Ta0.47 high entropy alloy (HEA) was prepared using mechanical alloying (MA) and spark plasma sintering (SPS) based on the unique design concept of HEAs and third-generation powder superalloys. The HEA phase formation rules of the alloy system were predicted but need to be verified empirically. The microstructure and phase structure of the HEA powder were investigated at different milling times and speeds, with different process control agents, and with an HEA block sintered at different temperatures. The milling time and speed do not affect the alloying process of the powder and increasing the milling speed reduces the powder particle size. After 50 h of milling with ethanol as PCA, the powder has a dual-phase FCC+BCC structure, and stearic acid as PCA inhibits the powder alloying. When the SPS temperature reaches 950 °C, the HEA transitions from a dual-phase to a single FCC phase structure and, with increasing temperature, the mechanical properties of the alloy gradually improve. When the temperature reaches 1150 °C, the HEA has a density of 7.92 g cm−3, a relative density of 98.7%, and a hardness of 1050 HV. The fracture mechanism is one with a typical cleavage, a brittle fracture with a maximum compressive strength of 2363 MPa and no yield point.\n",

      "In the field of wireless strain monitoring, it is difficult for the traditional metal-made antenna sensor to conform well with steel structures and monitor large strain deformation. To solve this problem, this study proposes a flexible antenna strain sensor based on a ductile graphene film, which features a 6.7% elongation at break and flexibility due to the microscopic wrinkle structure and layered stacking structure of the graphene film. Because of the use of eccentric embedding in the feeding form, the sensor can be miniaturized and can simultaneously monitor strain in two directions. The sensing mechanism of the antenna is analyzed using a void model, and an antenna is designed based on operating frequencies of 3 GHz and 3.5 GHz. The embedding size is optimized using a Smith chart and impedance matching principle. Both the simulation and experimental results verify that the resonant frequency and strain magnitude are linearly inversely proportional. The experimental results show that the strain sensitivity is 1.752 kHz/με along the geometric length and 1.780 kHz/με along the width, with correlation coefficients of 0.99173 and 0.99295, respectively.\n",

      "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are divided phylogenetically into six classes1,2, denoted A to F. More than 370 structures of vertebrate GPCRs (belonging to classes A, B, C and F) have been determined, leading to a substantial understanding of their function3. By contrast, there are no structures of class D GPCRs, which are found exclusively in fungi where they regulate survival and reproduction. Here we determine the structure of a class D GPCR, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pheromone receptor Ste2, in an active state coupled to the heterotrimeric G protein Gpa1â€“Ste4â€“Ste18. Ste2 was purified as a homodimer coupled to two G proteins. The dimer interface of Ste2 is formed by the N terminus, the transmembrane helices H1, H2 and H7, and the first extracellular loop ECL1. We establish a class D1 generic residue numbering system (CD1) to enable comparisons with orthologues and with other GPCR classes. The structure of Ste2 bears similarities in overall topology to class A GPCRs, but the transmembrane helix H4 is shifted by more than 20 Ã… and the G-protein-binding site is a shallow groove rather than a cleft. The structure provides a template for the design of novel drugs to target fungal GPCRs, which could be used to treat numerous intractable fungal diseases4.\n",

      "It is currently thought that life-long blood cell production is driven by the action of a small number of multipotent haematopoietic stem cells. Evidence supporting this view has been largely acquired through the use of functional assays involving transplantation. However, whether these mechanisms also govern native non-transplant haematopoiesis is entirely unclear. Here we have established a novel experimental model in mice where cells can be uniquely and genetically labelled in situ to address this question. Using this approach, we have performed longitudinal analyses of clonal dynamics in adult mice that reveal unprecedented features of native haematopoiesis. In contrast to what occurs following transplantation, steady-state blood production is maintained by the successive recruitment of thousands of clones, each with a minimal contribution to mature progeny. Our results demonstrate that a large number of long-lived progenitors, rather than classically defined haematopoietic stem cells, are the main drivers of steady-state haematopoiesis during most of adulthood. Our results also have implications for understanding the cellular origin of haematopoietic disease.\n",

      "Around 30â€“40% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) undergoing curative resection of the primary tumour will develop metastases in the subsequent years1. Therapies to prevent disease relapse remain an unmet medical need. Here we uncover the identity and features of the residual tumour cells responsible for CRC relapse. An analysis of single-cell transcriptomes of samples from patients with CRC revealed that the majority of genes associated with a poor prognosis are expressed by a unique tumour cell population that we named high-relapse cells (HRCs). We established a human-like mouse model of microsatellite-stable CRC that undergoes metastatic relapse after surgical resection of the primary tumour. Residual HRCs occult in mouse livers after primary CRC surgery gave rise to multiple cell types over time, including LGR5+ stem-like tumour cells2,3,4, and caused overt metastatic disease. Using Emp1 (encoding epithelial membrane protein 1) as a marker gene for HRCs, we tracked and selectively eliminated this cell population. Genetic ablation of EMP1high cells prevented metastatic recurrence and mice remained disease-free after surgery. We also found that HRC-rich micrometastases were infiltrated with T cells, yet became progressively immune-excluded during outgrowth. Treatment with neoadjuvant immunotherapy eliminated residual metastatic cells and prevented mice from relapsing after surgery. Together, our findings reveal the cell-state dynamics of residual disease in CRC and anticipate that therapies targeting HRCs may help to avoid metastatic relapse.\n",

A long-term radial velocity trend 4,5 as well as an astrometric acceleration6,7 led to claims of a giant planet2,8,9 orbiting the nearby star (3.6384Â±0.0013pc10). Here we report JWST coronagraphic images that reveal a giant exoplanet which is consistent with these radial and astrometric measurements, but inconsistent with the previously claimed planet properties. The new planet has temperature ~275K, and is remarkably bright at 10.65Âµm and 15.50Âµm. Non-detections between 3.5-5Âµm indicate an unknown opacity source in the atmosphere, possibly suggesting a high metallicity, high carbon-to-oxygen ratio planet. The best-fit temperature of the planet is consistent with theoretical thermal evolution models, which are previously untested at this temperature range. The data indicates that this is likely the only giant planet in the system and we therefore refer to it as â€œbâ€, despite it having significantly different orbital properties than the previously claimed planet â€œbâ€.\n",

      "Ageing is a degenerative process that leads to tissue dysfunction and death. A proposed cause of ageing is the accumulation of epigenetic noise that disrupts gene expression patterns, leading to decreases in tissue function and regenerative capacity1,2,3. Changes to DNA methylation patterns over time form the basis of ageing clocks4, but whether older individuals retain the information needed to restore these patternsâ€”and, if so, whether this could improve tissue functionâ€”is not known. Over time, the central nervous system (CNS) loses function and regenerative capacity5,6,7. Using the eye as a model CNS tissue, here we show that ectopic expression of Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1), Sox2 and Klf4 genes (OSK) in mouse retinal ganglion cells restores youthful DNA methylation patterns and transcriptomes, promotes axon regeneration after injury, and reverses vision loss in a mouse model of glaucoma and in aged mice. The beneficial effects of OSK-induced reprogramming in axon regeneration and vision require the DNA demethylases TET1 and TET2. These data indicate that mammalian tissues retain a record of youthful epigenetic informationâ€”encoded in part by DNA methylationâ€”that can be accessed to improve tissue function and promote regeneration in vivo.\n",

      "Membrane efflux pumps play a major role in bacterial multidrug resistance. The tripartite multidrug efflux pump system from Escherichia coli, AcrAB-TolC, is a target for inhibition to lessen resistance development and restore antibiotic efficacy, with homologs in other ESKAPE pathogens. Here, we rationalize a mechanism of inhibition against the periplasmic adaptor protein, AcrA, using a combination of hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, cellular efflux assays, and molecular dynamics simulations. We define the structural dynamics of AcrA and find that an inhibitor can inflict long-range stabilisation across all four of its domains, whereas an interacting efflux substrate has minimal effect. Our results support a model where an inhibitor forms a molecular wedge within a cleft between the lipoyl and {beta} domains of AcrA, diminishing its conformational transmission of drug-evoked signals from AcrB to TolC. This work provides molecular insights into multidrug adaptor protein function which could be valuable for developing antimicrobial therapeutics.\n",

      "Analysis of single-cell multiomics datasets is a novel topic and is considerably challenging because such datasets contain a large number of features with numerous missing values. In this study, we implemented a recently proposed tensor-decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) technique to address this difficult problem. The technique can successfully integrate single-cell multiomics data composed of gene expression, DNA methylation, and accessibility. Although the last two have large dimensions, as many as ten million, containing only a few percentages of non-zero values, TD-based unsupervised FE can integrate three omics datasets without filling missing values. Together with UMAP, which is used frequently when embedding single-cell measurements into two-dimensional space, TD-based unsupervised FE can produce two-dimensional embedding coincident with classification when integrating single-cell omics datasets. Genes selected based on TD-based unsupervised FE were also significantly related to reasonable biological roles.\n",

      "More species than ever before are at risk of extinction due to anthropogenic habitat loss and climate change. But even species that are not threatened have seen reductions in their populations and geographic ranges, likely impacting their genetic diversity. Although preserving genetic diversity is key to maintaining adaptability of species, we lack predictive tools and global estimates of genetic diversity loss across ecosystems. By bridging theories of biodiversity and population genetics, we introduce a mathematical framework to understand the loss of naturally occurring DNA mutations within decreasing habitat within a species. Analysing genome-wide variation data of 10,095 geo-referenced individuals from 20 plant and animal species, we show that genome-wide diversity follows a power law with geographic area (the mutations-area relationship), which can predict genetic diversity loss in spatial computer simulations of local population extinctions. Given pre-21st century values of ecosystem transformations, we estimate that over 10% of genetic diversity may already be lost, surpassing the United Nations targets for genetic preservation. These estimated losses could rapidly accelerate with advancing climate change and habitat destruction, highlighting the need for forecasting tools that facilitate implementation of policies to protect genetic resources globally.\n",

      "Quantitative functional magnetic resonance imaging methods make it possible to measure cerebral oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) in the human brain. Current methods require the subject to breathe special gas mixtures (hypercapnia and hyperoxia). We tested a noninvasive suite of methods to measure absolute CMRO2 in both baseline and dynamic activation states without the use of special gases: arterial spin labeling (ASL) to measure baseline and activation cerebral blood flow (CBF), with concurrent measurement of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal as a dynamic change in tissue R2*; VSEAN to estimate baseline O2 extraction fraction (OEF) from a measurement of venous blood R2, which in combination with the baseline CBF measurement yields an estimate of baseline CMRO2; and FLAIR-GESSE to measure tissue R2' to estimate the scaling parameter needed for calculating the change in CMRO2 in response to a stimulus with the calibrated BOLD method. Here we describe results for a study sample of 17 subjects (8 female, mean age=25.3 years, range 21-31 years). The primary findings were that OEF values measured with the VSEAN method were in good agreement with previous PET findings, while estimates of the dynamic change in CMRO2 in response to a visual stimulus were in good agreement between the traditional hypercapnia calibration and calibration based on R2'.

      "Reopening schools is an urgent priority as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on. To explore the risks associated with returning to in-person learning and the value of mitigation measures, we developed stochastic, network-based models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in primary and secondary schools. We find that a number of mitigation measures, alone or in concert, may reduce risk to acceptable levels. Student cohorting, in which students are divided into two separate populations that attend in-person classes on alternating schedules, can reduce both the likelihood and the size of outbreaks. Proactive testing of teachers and staff can help catch introductions early, before they spread widely through the school. In secondary schools, where the students are more susceptible to infection and have different patterns of social interaction, control is more difficult. Especially in these settings, planners should also consider testing students once or twice weekly. Vaccinating teachers and staff protects these individuals and may have a protective effect on students as well. Other mitigations, including mask-wearing, social distancing, and increased ventilation, remain a crucial component of any reopening plan.\n",

      "BackgroundThe outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) posed a significant public health challenge globally, with Brazil being no exception. Excess mortality during this period reached alarming levels. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), Systemic Hypertension (HTN), and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) were associated with increased mortality. However, the specific impact of DM and HTN on mortality during the pandemic remains poorly understood.\n",

      "MethodsThis study analyzed mortality data from Brazils mortality system, covering the period from 2015 to 2022. Data included all causes of death as listed on death certificates, categorized by International Classification of Diseases 10th edition (ICD-10) codes. Population data were obtained from the Brazilian Census. Mortality ratios (MRs) were calculated by comparing death rates in 2020, 2021, and 2022 to the average rates from 2015 to 2019. Adjusted MRs were calculated using Poisson models.\n",

      "ResultsBetween 2015 and 2022, Brazil recorded a total of 11,423,288 deaths. Death rates remained relatively stable until 2019 but experienced a sharp increase in 2020 and 2021. In 2022, although a decrease was observed, it did not return to pre-pandemic levels. This trend persisted even when analyzing records mentioning DM, HTN, or CVD. Excluding death certificates mentioning COVID-19 codes, the trends still showed increases from 2020 through 2022, though less pronounced.\n",

      "Alcohol consumption is an important risk factor for multiple diseases. It is typically assessed via self-report, which is open to measurement error and bias. Instead, molecular data such as blood-based DNA methylation (DNAm) could be used to derive a more objective measure of alcohol consumption by incorporating information from cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites known to be linked to the trait. Here, we explore the epigenetic architecture of self-reported weekly units of alcohol consumption in the Generation Scotland study. We first create a blood-based epigenetic score (EpiScore) of alcohol consumption using elastic net penalised linear regression. We explore the effect of pre-filtering for CpG features ahead of elastic net, as well as differential patterns by sex and by units consumed in the last week relative to an average week. The final EpiScore was trained on 16,717 individuals and tested in four external cohorts: the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBC) of 1921 and 1936, the Sister Study, and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (total N across studies > 10,000). The maximum Pearson correlation between the EpiScore and self-reported alcohol consumption within cohort ranged from 0.41 to 0.53. In LBC1936, higher EpiScore levels had significant associations with poorer global brain imaging metrics, whereas self-reported alcohol consumption did not. Finally, we identified two novel CpG loci via a Bayesian penalized regression epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of alcohol consumption. Together, these findings show how DNAm can objectively characterize patterns of alcohol consumption that associate with brain health, unlike self-reported estimates.\n",

      "ResultsWe identified [~]316,000 unique patients that were prescribed at least 2 drugs with CPIC Level A or B guidelines. Genetic analysis in PMBB identified that 98.9% of participants carry one or more PGx actionable alleles where treatment modification would be recommended. After linking the genetic data with prescription data from the EHR, 14.2% of participants (n=6157) were prescribed medications that could be impacted by their genotype (as indicated by their PharmCAT report). For example, 856 participants received clopidogrel who carried CYP2C19 reduced function alleles, placing them at increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular events. When we stratified by genetic ancestry, we found disparities in PGx allele frequencies and clinical burden. Clopidogrel users of Asian ancestry in PMBB had significantly higher rates of CYP2C19 actionable alleles than European ancestry users of clopidrogrel (p<0.0001, OR=3.68).\n",

       "{'text': 'There is a global concern and increasing reports regarding foodborne disease infections associated with consuming contaminated vegetables, seafood, meat, and poultry products. Among foodborne bacterial pathogens globally, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Shigella were the most frequently implicated in causing food poisoning infections in children and adults. In Saudi Arabia, the consumption rates of imported fresh fruits, vegetables, seafood, and meat products are considered high. Therefore, the development of simple PCR based DNA fingerprinting methods is essential to track the source and route of microbial contamination among imported frozen meat and seafood products. A total of 38 E. coli strains were subtyped using ERIC1R, ERIC2, and a pair combination (ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2) to generate genomic fingerprinting. The three Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus-Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR)-based primers were generated in 26, 24, and 16 different genotypes while using ERIC1R, ERIC2, and ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2, respectively. The Discrimination Index values obtained by ERIC1R, ERIC2, and ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 were 0.976, 0.965, and 0.903, respectively. ERIC1R and ERIC2 primers had the best discriminatory ability and typeability value and proved suitable for investigating genetic analysis among the population of E. coli strains. At the same time, the ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 primer pair has average discriminatory power and typeability value for differentiating E. coli strains. These results suggest that subtyping using ERIC1R and ERIC2 primer is a more reliable and rapid typing strategy for E. coli strains.  Escherichia coli is a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium, facultative anaerobic and classified as a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family. This bacterium is mainly of fecal origin and inhabits the digestive system of humans and animals and is usually released into environment and meanwhile found in municipal wastewater discharge effluent (Jang et al. 2017). In humans, E. coli are responsible for causing infections known as extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) and intestinal pathogenic E. coli (IPEC). The ExPEC are important causes of septicemia, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, peritonitis, wound infection, pneumonia, and a leading cause of meningitis in neonates (Bonten et al. 2021; Leimbach et al. 2013; Pitout 2012; Russo and Johnson 2003). E. coli has been documented is the most common cause of severe invasive bacteremia and sepsis in high-income countries, and these infections are exceeding other leading bacteremia causing pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pnumoniae in older ages populations (Poolman and Anderson 2018; Russo and Johnson 2003; Søgaard et al. 2011). The IPEC are pathotypes associated with intestinal infections and are also known as diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC). Several molecular typing methods have been used to track the source and route of microbial contamination (Ferrari et al. 2017; Foley et al. 2004; Kabuki et al. 2004; Nakamura et al. 2021; Ramadan et al. 2020). These methods included the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), ribotyping, multi-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and, whole genome sequencing (WGS). However, choosing an appropriate bacterial genotyping method depends on their own advantages and limitations concerning the availability of instrumentation, speed, cost, strengths, sensitivity, and user-friendly databases (Chen and Perfect 2017; Ramadan 2022; Zou et al. 2013). For this reason, finding a simple PCR-based method such as enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) and have been widely used because it’s easier, faster, and cheaper than PFGE or MLST for generating information about the genetic similarity of bacterial strains (Meacham et al. 2003; Souza et al. 2010). This study focuses on a practical approach to evaluate and optimize ERIC-PCR typing for E. coli strains based on a widely recognized protocol by Versalovic et al. (1991), which improves the discriminatory power of the ERIC-PCR typing method. This study compared the genetic similarities of strains isolated from humans and strains isolated from frozen beef imported from India and frozen shrimp imported from China and Vietnam. The ERIC primers have been evaluated as a useful molecular typing method for determining the genetic relationship between strains of E. coli isolated and collected from different sources.  Thirty-eight strains of E. coli were used in this study, and their sources are described in Table\\xa01. Among the 38 isolates of E. coli analyzed in this study, six of the collected strains were isolated from humans (Elhadi et al. 2020). Moreover, five, 13, and 14 strains were isolated from marketed retailed frozen beef imported from India and frozen shrimp imported from Vietnam and China, respectively. All strains isolated from frozen beef and shrimp were collected from our previous study on a microbiological examination of foodborne pathogens in imported frozen beef and shrimp in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia (unpublished data). All strains were reconfirmed to species-level identification by culturing on MacConkey agar (Oxoid, UK) and standard biochemical tests such as indole test and API 20E (BioMe’rieux, France) were used. All bacterial strains were sub-cultured and grown overnight on Tryptic soy agar (Oxoid, UK) plates. Before each DNA extraction, single colonies were picked from Tryptic soy agar (Oxoid, UK), inoculated into 5 ml of Luria Bertani (LB) broth, and incubated for 24\\xa0h at 37\\xa0°C. DNA was extracted with Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, USA). Steps of genomic DNA extraction from Gram-negative bacteria were performed according to the kit manufactural recommended protocol. All extracted DNA from all strains was kept and stored at -20°C for further use. The concentration of extracted DNA from all strains was measured and quantified by using the Quantus Fluorometer with the Quantifluor dsDNA system (Promega, USA). Steps of extracted DNA concentrations measurement were performed according to manufactural instructions of Quantus Fluorometer operating manual. E. coli strains were fingerprinted using ERIC-PCR with the following ERIC primers as described by Versalovic et al. (1991): ERIC1R primer (59-ATG TAA GCT CCT GGG GAT TCA C-39), ERIC2 (59-AAGTAAGTGACTGGGGTGAGCG-39) and the combined ERIC 1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC 2 primer pair. All ERIC primers in this study were synthesized and purchased from Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany). The PCR reaction mixture volume was 25\\xa0µl per reaction and consisted of 12.5\\xa0µl of GoTaq G2 Master Mixes (Promega, USA), 7.5\\xa0µl of nuclease-free water (Promega, USA), 2\\xa0µl of each ERIC primer, and 3\\xa0µl of 100 ng DNA template. ERIC-PCR amplification was performed in the Biorad T100 thermocycler (Biorad, USA) as described by Versalovic et al. (1991). Briefly, the initial denaturation at 95°C for 5\\xa0min, followed by 35 cycles of 10\\xa0min denaturation at 96°C, annealing for 1\\xa0min at 52°C, and extension for 1\\xa0min at 72°C. The final extension step was carried out for 10\\xa0min at 72°C. Amplified products of ERIC1R, ERIC2, and combined ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 were separated with 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis containing 1X TBE buffer (Promega, USA) at 80 volts for 120\\xa0min and 1 Kb GelPiolt plus ladders (Qiagen, Germany) and used as molecular markers. Electrophoresed agarose gel photography was captured using a Gel documentation system (G: Box, Syngene, UK). The pattern of DNA fingerprint bands generated by ERIC-PCR was analyzed using GelJ software (Heras et al. 2015). GelJ is a convenient software and appropriate for constructing phylogenetic trees and dendrograms to analyze gel electrophoresis DNA and fingerprint bands. Clustering analysis was designed with GelJ software based on the Dice similarity coefficient, and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) to compare the discriminatory power of ERIC1R, ERIC2, and ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 primers. The discriminatory power of each fingerprinting among the 38 unrelated strains was calculated for ERIC1R, ERIC2, and ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 using the Simpson’s index of diversity equation (Hunter and Gaston 1988): where D is the discriminatory power index, N is the total number of isolates, s is the total number of types, and nj is the number of strains belonging to the jth. Therefore, the discriminatory power index will be calculated from the distribution types of each isolate and based on the homogeneity and frequency distribution of isolate types. Thus, each isolate should have a different type (DI\\u2009=\\u20091), and typeable isolates will be grouped by achieving a DI of more than 0.90 for a reliable assessment of the clonal relatedness of isolates (Struelens 1996). The typeability of tested strains in this study was calculated according to the formula described by (Struelens 1996): Typeability (T)\\u2009=\\u2009T\\u2009=\\u2009Nt / N, Nt is the number of isolates designated a type and N is the number of isolates tested. The typeability of ERIC1R, ERIC2, and ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 was defined as the percentage of typeable isolates among the 38 unrelated strains.  Three ERIC primers (ERIC1R, ERIC2, and a combination of ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2) were evaluated to investigate the genetic relationship among 38 strains of E. coli isolated from different sources and geographic origins, as shown in Table\\xa01. The dendrogram of the obtained ERIC-PCR fingerprint pattern results was constructed using GelJ software version 2.0 to determine the strain’s genetic relatedness. Several studies have used ERIC-PCR and other PCR-based typing methods to differentiate between clonally related and unrelated bacterial strains to investigate epidemic clones circulated in the population and responsible for outbreaks (Struelens 1998). The study was designed to assess the discriminatory power of ERIC primers and to find out the genetic linkage between E. coli strains isolated from humans and strains isolated from frozen beef imported from India and frozen shrimp imported from China and Vietnam, respectively.  Among the 38 strains of E. coli analyzed by ERIC1R primer were generated fingerprint bands ranging in size from 250 to 1400\\xa0bp, and each profile consisted of three to ten bands (Fig.\\xa01-A). The DNA band patterns produced by ERIC1R primer were analyzed using the Dice coefficient. Numerical analysis of ERIC profiles revealed eight identical clusters (A-1 to A-8), and 26 genotypes (A1-26\\xa0A) were obtained, as presented in Table\\xa01; Fig.\\xa02. Of the 38 strains, 20 (52.6%) strains were grouped within these eight clusters, and the highest number of strains were seen in clusters A-5, A-6, and A-7. Other clusters from A-1 to A-4 and A-8 were composed of two strains each (Fig.\\xa02). Among the eight clusters, cluster A-2 was composed of two identical strains (ECSC30 and ECSS31) isolated from frozen shrimp imported from China and a human strain isolated in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Gel electrophoresis analysis of Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus-Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR) fingerprinting of unrelated E. coli strains (A) with ERIC1R, (B) ERIC2, and (C) ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC primer Dendrogram generated from Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus-Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR) fingerprinting using ERIC1R primer. The scale at the top of the dendrogram presents the genome similarity (%) On the other hand, 14 (36.8%) strains that showed a genetic similarity value greater than the 90% cut-off were considered genetically related (Fig.\\xa02). Among these strains, the ECSC21 isolated from frozen shrimp imported from China and ECSS33 isolated from the human origin in Saudi Arabia shared 97% genetic similarity. Moreover, the ECSS32 strain of human origin shared 95% genetic similarity with two strains in cluster A-4 isolated from frozen beef imported from India (Fig.\\xa02). Additionally, the ECSS34 strain of human origin showed 92% genetic similarity to two strains in cluster A-2. It is noteworthy that the ECSS36 of human origin shared 93% genetic similarity with the ECSI37 strain isolated from frozen beef imported from India (Fig.\\xa02). Among the ERIC type patterns generated by ERIC1R primer, four strains (ESC14, ECSS35, ECSV3, and ECSV29) were found to be diverse, with single lineages and similarities below 90% and these strains were considered genetically unrelated as indicated by the dice coefficient (Fig.\\xa02). Szczuka and Kaznowski (2004) indicated that strains with a similarity rate below 90% were considered genetically unrelated. The ERIC2 primer produced fingerprint bands ranging in size from 150 to 1200\\xa0bp, and each fingerprint profile consisted of five to ten bands (Fig.\\xa01-B). Numerical analysis of ERIC profiles revealed that seven distinct clusters (B-1 to B-7) and 24 genotypes (B1 to B24) were resolved, as shown in Table\\xa01; Fig.\\xa03. Among the 38 strains analyzed using ERIC2 primer, 21 (55.3%) grouped within these seven clusters were identical and shared a 100% genetic similarity (Fig.\\xa03). Moreover, 11 (28.9%) out of 38 strains showed a genetic similarity greater than the 90% cut-off value, and six strains were revealed as single lineages below 90% genetic similarity and considered genetically unrelated (Fig.\\xa03). These strains (ECSC14, ECSV4, ECBI37, ECSS36, ECSS34, and ECSC18) exhibited genetic similarity below 90% and were considered genetically unrelated (Fig.\\xa03). The highest number of strains were grouped in clusters B-3, B-4, and B-5, while other clusters were composed of between two to three strains in each cluster (Fig.\\xa03). Interestingly, cluster B-3 is composed of four identical strains and two of these strains (ECSV22 and ECSC30) were isolated from frozen shrimp imported from Vietnam and China, and other strains ECBI42 and ECSS35 were isolated from beef imported from India and humans in Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia (Fig.\\xa03). Dendrogram generated from Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus-Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR) fingerprinting using ERIC2 primer. The scale at the top of the dendrogram presents the genome similarity (%) Concerning the combination of ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 primer, two to five bands were obtained for each fingerprint and sizes ranging between 200 and 1200\\xa0bp (Fig.\\xa01-C). Among the 38 strains, six strains were not typeable by ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 primer (Table\\xa01). The ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 primer revealed 16 genotypes (C1 to C16) and six clusters (C-1 to C-6) among the 32 genotyped strains, as shown in Fig.\\xa04. Of the 32 strains, 22 (57.9%) were grouped within these six clusters, and the highest number of strains were composed in cluster C-3 (Fig.\\xa04). Eighteen strains of E. coli isolated from frozen shrimp imported from China and Vietnam were grouped in identical clusters (C-3, C-4, C-5, and C-6) and showed 100% genetic similarities. Moreover, all strains isolated from frozen beef imported from India were grouped in separated clusters (C-1 and C-2), and except for strain, ECSI38 exhibited a single lineage cluster below 90% genetic similarity (Fig.\\xa04). Among the five strains of human origin genotyped by ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 primer, only one strain, ECSS31, shows 93% genetic similarity to strain ECSC30 isolated from frozen shrimp imported from China. The other four strains of human origin exhibited single lineages and revealed genetic similarity below 90% and were considered genetically unrelated (Fig.\\xa04). Dendrogram generated from Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus-Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR) fingerprinting using the ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 primer combination The calculated discrimination indexes obtained by ERIC-1R, ERIC-2, and the ERIC-1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC-2 combination were 0.976, 0.965, and 0.903, respectively (Table\\xa02). The Discrimination Index obtained by all evaluated ERIC primers was considered acceptable and above the confidence value (Szczuka and Kaznowski 2004). Among the three evaluated ERIC primers, the best discriminatory ability for epidemiological concordance was obtained by ERIC-1R (DI\\u2009=\\u20090.976) and ERIC-2 (DI\\u2009=\\u20090.965), and both primers revealed a 100% typeability value (Table\\xa02). Among the three investigated ERIC primers, the least typeability of 84% was obtained by the ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 primer pair (Table\\xa02). Our results suggest that the ERIC1R and ERIC2 primer are effective and suitable in differentiating genetic relatedness of E. coli isolated from different sources, and ERIC-PCR should be adopted as a molecular typing technique for tracking monitoring transmission during pathogenic E. coli outbreaks. In this study, the ERIC1R and ERIC2 primers had the best discriminatory ability and typeability value and proved to be suitable for epidemiological investigation and genetic analysis among the population of E. coli strains. A similar study conducted elsewhere evaluated ERIC-PCR primers as PCR-based tools to discriminate against different bacterial strains and concluded that the ERIC2 primer set had shown a more reliable ability to discriminate against the analyzed strains (Zara et al. 2006). In this study, the ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 primer combination had a discriminatory power value of D\\u2009=\\u20090.903 for differentiating E. coli strains (Table\\xa02). However, several published articles used a combination of ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 primer as recommended in previously published studies elsewhere (Versalovic et al. 1991; Woods et al. 1993). Therefore, our obtained results in this study suggesting the use of ERIC1R and ERIC2 primer without combination will generate a more discriminative value index than the combination of the two primers. Furthermore, ERIC primers should be optimized to identify which primer will give an excellent typeability and discriminatory power, as were claimed in some published articles using the ERIC primer without specifying the exact primer used in ERIC-PCR protocol. Construction of phylogenetic trees based on ERIC-PCR fingerprint patterns generated by ERIC1R, ERIC-2, and ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 primers revealed a total of eight, seven, and six identical unique clusters with 100% similarity index (Figs.\\xa02 and 3, and 4). However, the ECSS31 strain was isolated from humans and was found to be identical to the ECSC30 strain isolated from frozen shrimp imported from China, as shown in Cluster A-2 (Fig.\\xa02). Similarly, a phylogenetic tree based on ERIC-PCR fingerprint patterns generated by ERIC-2 primer revealed three strains (ECSV22, ECSC30, and ECBI42) isolated from frozen shrimp and beef imported from Vietnam, China, and India, respectively, showed identical relatedness to human strain (ECSS35), as shown in Cluster B-3 (Fig.\\xa03). A phylogenetic tree generated by a combination of ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 primer revealed the ECSS31 strain isolated from humans shared 92% genetic similarity with the ECSC30 strain isolated from frozen shrimp imported from China (Fig.\\xa04). However, identical genetic linkage of these strains isolated from imported frozen beef and shrimp to human strains (ECSS31 and ECSS35) associated with gastroenteritis in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia indicates contamination of imported frozen beef and shrimp as a possible vehicle source of infection. Our study also revealed a strong genetic relationship between E. coli strains isolated from frozen shrimp imported from China formed identical group clones (Clusters: C-3, C-5, and C-6) with strains isolated from frozen shrimp imported from Vietnam (Fig.\\xa04). Furthermore, we identified E. coli strain ECBI38 isolated from frozen beef imported from India had identical genetic similarity (Cluster: B-6) with strains isolated from frozen shrimp imported from China and Vietnam (Fig.\\xa03). Therefore, genetic identical similarity patterns of these clones of E. coli strains proved that these strains are circulated and exist in these areas and might be spread through imported frozen beef and shrimp, lacking adequate hygiene during handling, storage, transportation, and commercialization the point of sale. A similar study conducted elsewhere demonstrated that contaminated frozen seafood and shrimp might play an important role in disseminating virulent and multi-drug resistant enterobacteria strains. Also, the study found that E. coli isolates harbored major virulence genes and their contamination levels are beyond the recommended limits (Barbosa et al. 2016; Dib et al. 2018). Our study also revealed that four out of six E. coli strains recovered from humans in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia were different clones, and only two strains (ECSS31 and ECSS35) were grouped in identical clone clusters with strains isolated from frozen shrimp imported from China as indicated in cluster: A-2 (Fig.\\xa02). Also, the ECSS35 strain formed an identical clone with E. coli strains isolated from frozen beef and shrimp imported from India, China, and Vietnam, as indicated in cluster: B-3 (Fig.\\xa03). E. coli comprise a diverse group of bacteria with pathogenic variants, pathovars responsible for causing morbidity and mortality. These pathogen have low infectious doses and are transmitted through food and water, causing major public health problems (Croxen et al. 2013). Food or water might be contaminated with the feces of infected humans and animals, and this contamination plays a significant role in the transmission of E. coli. Contamination of meat and seafood products often occurs during the processing and packing (García et al. 2010). In addition, the use of manures from animals as fertilizer can contaminate food and irrigation water (Croxen et al. 2013; García et al. 2010). Another area of interest we found in our study was the determination of genetic similarity among strains isolated from frozen shrimp imported from China and Vietnam; these were grouped in identical clone clusters. However, the present study revealed the coexistence of this circulated identical clone of E. coli in these geographical areas. Over the last two decades, several authors have used ERIC-PCR as a rapid molecular typing method for determining genetic relationships among several bacterial species isolated from food, environmental, and human samples. In this study, ERIC-PCR demonstrated excellent discrimination among unrelated E. coli strains, and this method is a useful DNA fingerprinting technique for distinguishing E. coli isolated from different sources (Ateba and Mbewe 2014; Dorneles et al. 2014; Fendri et al. 2013; Gautam et al. 2022; Igwaran and Okoh 2020; Pakbin et al. 2021; de Sa Guimaraes et al. 2011; Szczuka and Kaznowski 2004). Our results indicate that imported frozen beef and shrimp products might become an important source of enteric pathogenic E. coli in Saudi Arabia. The use of ERIC-PCR typing provides information on the genetic relatedness of E. coli strains isolated from humans to E. coli strains isolated from imported frozen beef and shrimp in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. However, our findings indicate that the use of ERIC1R, ERIC2, and a combination of ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 is effective in finding genetic relatedness among strains of E. coli isolated from human and retail imported frozen shrimp and beef sources and facilitating a better understanding of the transmission route and tracking the origin of pathogenic E. coli in Saudi Arabia. The identical overlap of two strains (ECSS31 and ECSS35) isolated from humans and strains of E. coli strains isolated from frozen beef and shrimp imported from India, China, and Vietnam highlights the importance of these sources for human enteric pathogenic E. coli in Saudi Arabia. The ERIC-PCR results demonstrated a clear source of contamination that may occur in the harvest area of shrimp and handling or storage of meat and shrimp. However, there is an urgent need for monitoring programs, and rigorous molecular studies are required to track the exact source of contaminants of enteric pathogenic E. coli and other pathogens in imported frozen beef, shrimps, and other frozen seafood and meat products. Consequently, accurate control measures by food authorities must be implemented to warranty a safe quality of imported frozen seafood and meat products for adequate consumer protection.  The three ERIC primers evaluated in this study were varied in their abilities to discriminate E. coil strains isolated from different sources (human, frozen beef, and frozen shrimp). Based on the discriminatory power values of fingerprinting of three ERIC primers, the ERIC1R and ERIC2 primers had the best discriminatory ability and typeability value and proved to be suitable for investigating genetic analysis among the population of E. coli strains. The evaluation of ERIC-PCR method in this study proved ERIC-PCR to be rapid, easy to perform, cost-effective, and could be implemented as a molecular typing method to discriminate enteric pathogenic E. coli from other strains of E. coli isolated from food and environmental sources.

       "  'abstract': 'There is a global concern and increasing reports regarding foodborne disease infections associated with consuming contaminated vegetables, seafood, meat, and poultry products. Among foodborne bacterial pathogens globally, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Shigella were the most frequently implicated in causing food poisoning infections in children and adults. In Saudi Arabia, the consumption rates of imported fresh fruits, vegetables, seafood, and meat products are considered high. Therefore, the development of simple PCR based DNA fingerprinting methods is essential to track the source and route of microbial contamination among imported frozen meat and seafood products. A total of 38 E. coli strains were subtyped using ERIC1R, ERIC2, and a pair combination (ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2) to generate genomic fingerprinting. The three Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus-Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR)-based primers were generated in 26, 24, and 16 different genotypes while using ERIC1R, ERIC2, and ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2, respectively. The Discrimination Index values obtained by ERIC1R, ERIC2, and ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 were 0.976, 0.965, and 0.903, respectively. ERIC1R and ERIC2 primers had the best discriminatory ability and typeability value and proved suitable for investigating genetic analysis among the population of E. coli strains. At the same time, the ERIC1R\\u2009+\\u2009ERIC2 primer pair has average discriminatory power and typeability value for differentiating E. coli strains. These results suggest that subtyping using ERIC1R and ERIC2 primer is a more reliable and rapid typing strategy for E. coli strains.'}}"
