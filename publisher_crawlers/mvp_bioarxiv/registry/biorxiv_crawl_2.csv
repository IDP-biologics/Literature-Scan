10.1101/183467|Integrating genomic resources for a threatened Caribbean coral (Orbicella faveolata) using a genetic linkage map developed from individual larval genotypes|Snelling, J.; Dziedzic, K.; Guermond, S.; Meyer, E.|Eli  Meyer|Oregon State University|2017-09-01|1|new results|cc_by_nd|genomics|https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/01/183467.source.xml|Genomic methods are powerful tools for studying evolutionary responses to selection, but the application of these tools in non-model systems threatened by climate change has been limited by the availability of genomic resources in those systems. High-throughput DNA sequencing has enabled development of genome and transcriptome assemblies in non-model systems including reef-building corals, but the fragmented nature of early draft assemblies often obscures the relative positions of genes and genetic markers, and limits the functional interpretation of genomic studies in these systems. To address this limitation and improve genomic resources for the study of adaptation to ocean warming in corals, weve developed a genetic linkage map for the mountainous star coral, Orbicella faveolata. We analyzed genetic linkage among multilocus SNP genotypes to infer the relative positions of markers, transcripts, and genomic scaffolds in an integrated genomic map. To illustrate the utility of this resource, we tested for genetic associations with bleaching responses and fluorescence phenotypes, and estimated genome-wide patterns of population differentiation. Mapping the significant markers identified from these analyses in the integrated genomic resource identified hundreds of genes linked to significant markers, highlighting the utility of this resource for genomic studies of corals. The functional interpretations drawn from genomic studies are often limited by the availability of genomic resources linking genes to genetic markers. The resource developed in this study provides a framework for comparing genetic studies of O. faveolata across genotyping methods or references, and illustrates an approach for integrating genomic resources that may be broadly useful in other non-model systems.|NA|biorxiv

A.|Niklas  Wilming|University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf|2017-09-01|1|new results|cc_by_nc_nd|neuroscience|https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/01/183327.source.xml|Grid cells have been identified in the entorhinal cortex in a variety of species and allow for the precise decoding of position in space (1-7). Along with potentially playing an important role in navigation, grid cells have recently been hypothesized to make a general contribution to mental operations, including remembering the past and thinking about the future (8,9). A prerequisite for this hypothesis is that grid cell activity does not critically depend on physical movement. Directed attention, which contributes to virtually all mental operations and can be separated from physical movement provides a good test case to investigate this hypothesis. Overt attention in the form of fixational eye movements leads to grid-like firing fields in the monkey entorhinal cortex (3). Here we show that movement of covert attention, without any physical movement, also elicits spatial receptive fields with a triangular tiling of the space. In monkeys trained to maintain central fixation while covertly attending to a stimulus moving in the periphery we identified a significant population (20/141, 14% neurons at a FDR<5%) of entorhinal cells with spatially structured receptive fields. Further, we were able to identify a population of neurons that were labeled as grid cells on an individual basis. This contrast with our recordings obtained in the hippocampus, where grid-like representations were not observed. Our results provide compelling evidence that neurons in macaque entorhinal cortex do not rely on physical movement. Notably, these results support the notion that grid cells may be capable of serving a variety of different cognitive functions and suggest that grid cells are a versatile component of many neural algorithms.|10.7554/eLife.31745|biorxiv

In the wild, however, cells rarely experience constant environments. Here, we examine how the 24-hour circadian clock and environmental cycles modulate cell size control and division timings in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus using single-cell time-lapse microscopy. Under constant light, wild type cells follow an apparent sizer-like principle. Closer inspection reveals that the clock generates two subpopulations, with cells born in the subjective day following different division rules from cells born in subjective night. A stochastic model explains how this behaviour emerges from the interaction of cell size control with the clock. We demonstrate that the clock continuously modulates the probability of cell division throughout day and night, rather than solely applying an on-off gate to division as previously proposed. Iterating between modelling and experiments, we go on to show that the combined effects of the environment and the clock on cell division are explained by an effective coupling function. Under naturally graded light-dark cycles, this coupling shifts cell division away from dusk and dawn, when light levels are low and cell growth is reduced. Our analysis allows us to disentangle, and predict the effects of, the complex interactions between the environment, clock, and cell size control.|10.1073/pnas.1811309115|biorxiv

However, dimension reduction to interpret structure in single-cell sequencing data remains a challenge. Existing algorithms are either not able to uncover the clustering structures in the data, or lose global information such as groups of clusters that are close to each other. We present a robust statistical model, scvis, to capture and visualize the low-dimensional structures in single-cell gene expression data. Simulation results demonstrate that low-dimensional representations learned by scvis preserve both the local and global neighbour structures in the data. In addition, scvis is robust to the number of data points and learns a probabilistic parametric mapping function to add new data points to an existing embedding. We then use scvis to analyze four single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets, exemplifying interpretable two-dimensional representations of the high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing data.|10.1038/s41467-018-04368-5|biorxiv

Data are a resource that can be repurposed and reused providing dividends on the original investment used to support the primary work. Moreover, it is the cornerstone upon which a tested hypothesis is rejected or accepted and specific scientific conclusions are reached. Understanding how and where it is being produced enhances the transparency and reproducibility of the biomedical research enterprise. Most biomedical data are not directly deposited in data repositories and are instead found in the publication within figures or attachments making it hard to measure. We attempted to address this challenge by using recent advances in word embedding to identify the technical and methodological features of terms used in the free text of articles methods sections. We created term usage signatures for five types of biomedical research data, which were used in univariate clustering to correctly identify a large fraction of positive control articles and a set of manually annotated articles where generation of data types could be validated. The approach was then used to estimate the fraction of PLOS articles generating each biomedical data type over time. Out of all PLOS articles analyzed (n = 129,918), ~7%, 19%, 12%, 18%, and 6% generated flow cytometry, immunoassay, genomic microarray, microscopy, and high-throughput sequencing data. The estimate portends a vast amount of biomedical data being produced: in 2016, if other publishers generated a similar amount of data then roughly 40,000 NIH-funded research articles would produce ~56,000 datasets consisting of the five data types we analyzed.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryApplication of a word-embedding model trained on the methods sections of research articles allows for estimation of the production of diverse biomedical data types using text mining.|NA|biorxiv

Currently a wide range of personal activity trackers are commercially available, providing a wide variety of sensor configurations. For many of these devices, accelerometry provides the basis of measuring both physical activity and sleep with comparable derivative measures.\n\nResultsIn order to include an ecological biotracker in the Healthy Brain Network protocol, we first evaluated the specifications of a variety of actimeters available for purchase. We then acquired physical instances of 5 of these devices (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT, Empatica Embrace, Empatica E4, GENEActiv Original, and Wavelet Wristband) and wore each of them in our daily lives, annotating our activities and evaluating the reasonableness of the data from each device and the logistical affordances of each device.\n\nConclusionsWe decided that the ActiGraph wGT3X-BT is the most appropriate device for inclusion in the Healthy Brain Network. However, none of the devices we evaluated was clearly superior or inferior to the rest; rather, each device seems to have use cases in which that device excels beyond the others.|NA|biorxiv

The aquatic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus uses a discrete polar polysaccharide complex, the holdfast, to strongly attach to surfaces and resist flow. The holdfast is extremely versatile and has an impressive adhesive strength. Here, we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) to unravel the complex structure of the holdfast and characterize its chemical constituents and their role in adhesion. We used purified holdfasts to dissect the intrinsic properties of this component as a biomaterial, without the effect of the bacterial cell body. Our data support a model where the holdfast is a heterogeneous material composed of two layers: a stiff nanoscopic core, covered by a sparse, flexible brush layer. These two layers contain not only N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG), the only yet identified component present in the holdfast, but also peptides and DNA, which provide structure and adhesive character. Biochemical experiments suggest that, while polypeptides are the most important components for adhesive force, the presence of DNA mainly impacts the brush layer and initial adhesion, and NAG plays a primarily structural role within the core. Moreover, our results suggest that holdfast matures structurally, becoming more homogeneous over time. The unanticipated complexity of both the structure and composition of the holdfast likely underlies its distinctive strength as a wet adhesive and could inform the development of a versatile new family of adhesives.|10.1128/mbio.02359-17|biorxiv

SMN has been implicated in transport of mRNA in neural cells for local translation. We previously identified microtubule-dependant mobile vesicles rich in SMN and the splicing factor SmB, a member of the Sm protein family, in neural cells. By comparing the proteome of SmB to that of SmN, a neural-specific Sm protein, we now show that the essential neural protein neurochondrin (NCDN) interacts with Sm proteins and SMN in the context of mobile vesicles in neurites. NCDN has roles in protein localisation in neural cells, and in maintenance of cell polarity. NCDN is required for the correct localisation of SMN, suggesting they may both be required for formation and transport of trafficking vesicles. NCDN provides a potential therapeutic target for SMA together with, or in place of, those targeting SMN expression.|10.1242/jcs.211482|biorxiv

Leveraging associations of current geographic distributions of bacteria with historic climate, we predict that soil bacterial diversity will increase across the majority (~75%) of the Tibetan Plateau and northern North America if bacterial communities equilibrate with existing climatic conditions. This prediction is possible because the current distributions of soil bacteria have stronger correlations with climate from ~50 years ago than with current climate. This lag is likely associated with the time it takes for soil properties to adjust to changes in climate. The predicted changes are location specific and differ across bacterial taxa, including some bacteria that are predicted to have reductions in their distributions. These findings demonstrate the widespread influence that climate change will have on belowground diversity and highlight the importance of considering bacterial communities when assessing climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nIMPORTANCEThere have been many studies highlighting how plant and animal communities lag behind climate change, causing extinction and diversity debts that will slowly be paid as communities equilibrate. By virtue of their short generation times and dispersal abilities, soil bacteria might be expected to respond to climate change quickly and to be effectively in equilibrium with current climatic conditions. We found strong evidence to the contrary in Tibet and North America. These findings could significantly improve understanding of climate impacts on soil microbial communities.|NA|biorxiv

Despite similar protein sequences, histone variants are enriched for different suites of PTMs compared to their canonical counterparts. For example, variant histone H3.3 occurs primarily in transcribed regions and is enriched for \""active\"" histone PTMs like Lys9 acetylation (H3.3K9ac), whereas the canonical histone H3 is enriched for Lys9 methylation (H3K9me), which is found in transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. To determine the functions of K9 modification on variant versus canonical H3, we compared the phenotypes caused by engineering H3.3K9R and H3K9R mutant genotypes in Drosophila melanogaster. Whereas most H3.3K9R and a small number of H3K9R mutant animals are capable of completing development and do not have substantially altered protein coding transcriptomes, all H3.3K9R H3K9R combined mutants die soon after embryogenesis and display decreased expression of genes enriched for K9ac. These data suggest that the role of K9ac in gene activation during development can be provided by either H3 or H3.3. Conversely, we found that H3.3K9 is methylated at telomeric transposons, and this mark contributes to repressive chromatin architecture, supporting a role for H3.3 in heterochromatin that is distinct from that of H3. Thus, our genetic and molecular analyses demonstrate that K9 modification of variant and canonical H3 have overlapping roles in development and transcriptional regulation, though to differing extents in euchromatin and heterochromatin."|10.1534/genetics.117.300480|biorxiv

Bayesian inference is the statistically optimal strategy for performing belief updating in the presence of uncertainty. An important open question is whether the use of cognitive strategies that implement Bayesian inference is dependent upon motivational state and, if so, how this is reflected in electrophysiological signatures of belief updating in the brain. Here we recorded the electroencephalogram of participants performing a simple reward learning task with both monetary and non-monetary instructive feedback conditions. Our aim was to distinguish the influence of the rewarding properties of feedback on belief updating from the information content of the feedback itself. A Bayesian updating model allowed us to quantify different aspects of belief updating across trials, including the size of belief updates and the uncertainty of beliefs. Faster learning rates were observed in the monetary feedback condition compared to the instructive feedback condition, while belief updates were generally larger, and belief uncertainty smaller, with monetary compared to instructive feedback. Larger amplitudes in the monetary feedback condition were found for three event-related potential components: the P3a, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the late positive potential (LPP). These findings suggest that motivational state influences inference strategies in reward learning, and this is reflected in the electrophysiological correlates of belief updating.|10.1111/psyp.13431|biorxiv

In the current functional MRI study involving healthy adult human volunteers, we investigated interactions between proximity, direction (approach vs. retreat), and speed during a dynamic threat-of-shock paradigm. As a measure of threat-evoked physiological arousal, skin conductance responses were recorded during fMRI scanning. Whereas some brain regions tracked individual threat-related factors, others were also sensitive to combinations of these variables. In particular, signals in the anterior insula tracked the interaction between proximity and direction where approach vs. retreat responses were stronger when threat was closer compared to farther. A parallel proximity-by-direction interaction was also observed in physiological skin conductance responses. In the right amygdala, we observed a proximity by direction interaction, but intriguingly in the opposite direction as the anterior insula; retreat vs. approach responses were stronger when threat was closer compared to farther. In the right bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, we observed an effect of threat proximity, whereas in the right periaqueductal gray/midbrain we observed an effect of threat direction and a proximity by direction by speed interaction (the latter was detected in exploratory analyses but not in a voxelwise fashion). Together, our study refines our understanding of the brain mechanisms involved during aversive anticipation in the human brain.

We found that after training, recurrent units developed into clusters that are functionally specialized for various cognitive processes. We introduce a measure to quantify relationships between single-unit neural representations of tasks, and report five distinct types of such relationships that can be tested experimentally. Surprisingly, our network developed compositionality of task representations, a critical feature for cognitive flexibility, whereby one task can be performed by recombining instructions for other tasks. Finally, we demonstrate how the network could learn multiple tasks sequentially. This work provides a computational platform to investigate neural representations of many cognitive tasks.|NA|biorxiv

We show that Lhx2, which encodes a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor essential for specification and differentiation of retinal Muller glia, also plays a critical role in the development of retinal neurons. Overexpression of Lhx2, and its transcriptional coactivator Ldb1, triggers cell cycle exit and inhibits both Notch signaling and retinal gliogenesis. Lhx2/Ldb1 overexpression also induced the formation of wide-field amacrine cells (wfACs). In contrast Rnf12, which encodes a negative regulator of LDB1, is necessary for the initiation of retinal gliogenesis. We also show that LHX2 protein binds upstream of multiple neurogenic bHLH factors including Ascl1 and Neurog2, which are necessary for suppression of gliogenesis and wfAC formation respectively, and activates their expression. Finally, we demonstrate that the relative level of the LHX2-LDB1 complex in the retina decreases in tandem with the onset of gliogenesis. These findings show that control of Lhx2 function by Ldb1 and Rnf12 acts as a molecular mechanism underpinning the coordinated differentiation of neurons and Muller glia in postnatal retina.\n\nSignificance StatementThe molecular mechanisms that control the ratio neurons and glia that are generated by neuronal progenitors remain unclear. Here we show that Lhx2, a transcription factor essential for retinal gliogenesis, also controls development of retinal neurons. The Lhx2 coactivator Ldb1 promotes Lhx2-dependent neurogenesis, while the Lhx2 corepressor Rnf12 is necessary and sufficient for retinal gliogenesis. Furthermore, Lhx2 directly regulates expression of bHLH factors that promote neural development, which are necessary for Lhx2-dependent neurogenesis. Finally, we show that levels of the LHX2-LDB1 complex, which activates transcription, drop as gliogenesis begins.

S.; Blackshaw, S.|Seth  Blackshaw|Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine|2017-09-04|2|new results|cc_no|neuroscience|https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/04/183285.source.xml|Precise control of the relative ratio of retinal neurons and glia generated during development is essential for visual function. We show that Lhx2, which encodes a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor essential for specification and differentiation of retinal Muller glia, also plays a critical role in the development of retinal neurons. Overexpression of Lhx2, and its transcriptional coactivator Ldb1, triggers cell cycle exit and inhibits both Notch signaling and retinal gliogenesis. Lhx2/Ldb1 overexpression also induced the formation of wide-field amacrine cells (wfACs). In contrast Rnf12, which encodes a negative regulator of LDB1, is necessary for the initiation of retinal gliogenesis. We also show that LHX2 protein binds upstream of multiple neurogenic bHLH factors including Ascl1 and Neurog2, which are necessary for suppression of gliogenesis and wfAC formation respectively, and activates their expression. Finally, we demonstrate that the relative level of the LHX2-LDB1 complex in the retina decreases in tandem with the onset of gliogenesis. These findings show that control of Lhx2 function by Ldb1 and Rnf12 acts as a molecular mechanism underpinning the coordinated differentiation of neurons and Muller glia in postnatal retina.\n\nSignificance StatementThe molecular mechanisms that control the ratio neurons and glia that are generated by neuronal progenitors remain unclear. Here we show that Lhx2, a transcription factor essential for retinal gliogenesis, also controls development of retinal neurons. The Lhx2 coactivator Ldb1 promotes Lhx2-dependent neurogenesis, while the Lhx2 corepressor Rnf12 is necessary and sufficient for retinal gliogenesis. Furthermore, Lhx2 directly regulates expression of bHLH factors that promote neural development, which are necessary for Lhx2-dependent neurogenesis. Finally, we show that levels of the LHX2-LDB1 complex, which activates transcription, drop as gliogenesis begins. Dynamic regulation of Lhx2 activity by Ldb1 and Rnf12 thus controls the relative levels of retinal neurogenesis and gliogenesis, and may have similar functions elsewhere in the developing nervous system.|10.1242/dev.159970|biorxiv

Coupled with PLC activation is a sequence of reactions spread across multiple compartments by which PIP2 is resynthesized, a process essential to maintain PIP2 levels and support sustained PLC signalling. The biochemical strategies to co-ordinate these reactions and support PIP2 levels have remained poorly understood. In particular, the question of whether the PIP2 cycle is a closed cycle with no net addition or loss of metabolites has not been addressed. Using mathematical modelling approaches, we find that a closed PIP2 cycle cannot explain experimentally observed changes in the metabolic intermediates when changing enzyme activities in the PIP2 cycle. Thus, we propose that the PIP2 cycle likely includes at least one metabolic source and one sink whose net activity results in the experimentally observed regulation of this key signalling pathway.|10.1002/1873-3468.12998|biorxiv

The contributions due to docking of the approximately thirteen residue neck linker to the leading head (deemed to be the power stroke), and diffusion of the trailing head contribute in propelling the motor by 16 nm have not been quantified. We use molecular simulations by creating a new coarse-grained model of the microtubule-kinesin complex, which reproduces the measured stall force as well as the force required to dislodge the motor head from the MT, to show that nearly three quarters of the step occurs by bidirectional stochastic motion of the TH. However, docking of the neck linker to the leading head constrains the extent of diffusion and minimizes the probability that kinesin takes side steps implying that both the events are necessary in the motility of kinesin, and for the maintenance of processivity. Surprisingly, we find that during a single step the trailing head stochastically hops multiple times between the geometrically accessible neighboring sites on the MT prior to forming a stable interaction with the target binding site with correct orientation between the motor head and the /{beta} tubulin dimer.\n\nSignificance StatementLike all motors, the stepping of the two headed conventional Kinesin on the microtubule is facilitated by conformational changes in the motor domain upon ATP binding and hydrolysis. Numerous experiments have revealed that docking of the thirteen residue neck linker (NL) to the motor domain of the leading plays a critical role in propelling the trailing head towards the plus end of the microtubule by nearly 16 nm in a single step. Surprisingly our molecular simulations reveal that nearly three quarters of the step occurs by stochastic diffusion of the trailing head. Docking of the NL restricts the extent of diffusion, thus forcing the motor to walk with overwhelming probability on a single protofilament of the MT.|10.1073/pnas.1706014114|biorxiv

Chaperones of the heat shock protein (HSP) family help control proteostasis by reducing the burden of unfolded proteins. They also oversee the formation of protein aggregates. Here, we explore how AMPylation - a post-translational protein modification that has emerged as a powerful modulator of HSP70 activity - influences the dynamics of protein aggregation. We find that adjustments of cellular AMPylation levels in C.elegans directly affect aggregation properties and associated toxicity of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), of a polyglutamine (polyQ)- extended polypeptide and of -synuclein (-syn). Expression of a constitutively active C. elegans AMPylase Fic-1(E274G) under its own promoter expedites aggregation of A{beta} and -syn, and drastically reduces their toxicity. A deficiency in AMPylation decreases the cellular tolerance for aggregation-prone polyQ proteins and alters their aggregation behavior. Over-expression of Fic-1(E274G) interferes with cell survival and larval development, underscoring the need for tight control of AMPylase activity in vivo. We thus define a link between HSP70 AMPylation and the dynamics of protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disease models. Our results are consistent with a cyto-protective, rather than a cytotoxic role for such protein aggregates.|10.1073/pnas.1801989115|biorxiv

Of the 25 individuals, five carried a variant consistent with a previous clinical diagnosis, thirteen were not previously diagnosed but had symptoms or family history with probable association with the detected variant, and seven reported no symptoms or family history of disease. A limited carrier screen was performed yielding 15 variants in 48 (6.1%) parents. Parents were also analyzed as mate-pairs to identify cases in which both parents were carriers for the same recessive disease; this led to one finding in ATP7B.

This question is particularly challenging because the elaboration of specific shapes is in essence a question of mechanics. In plants, this means how the genetic circuitry affects the cell wall. The mechanical properties of the wall and their spatial variation are the key factors controlling morphogenesis in plants. However, these properties are difficult to measure and investigating their relation to genetic regulation is particularly challenging. To measure spatial variation of mechanical properties, one must determine the deformation of a tissue in response to a known force with cellular resolution. Here we present an automated confocal micro-extensometer (ACME), which greatly expands the scope of existing methods for measuring mechanical properties. Unlike classical extensometers, ACME is mounted on a confocal microscope and utilizes confocal images to compute the deformation of the tissue directly from biological markers, thus providing cellular scale information and improved accuracy. ACME is suitable for measuring the mechanical responses in live tissue. As a proof of concept we demonstrate that the plant hormone gibberellic acid induces a spatial gradient in mechanical properties along the length of the Arabidopsis hypocotyl.\n\nTerms|10.1105/tpc.17.00753|biorxiv

Cells in a partial EMT or hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype tend to exhibit collective cell migration, forming clusters of circulating tumour cells - the primary drivers of metastasis. Activation of cell-cell signalling pathways such as Notch fosters a partial or complete EMT, yet the mechanisms enabling cluster formation remain poorly understood. Using an integrated computational-experimental approach, we examine the role of Numb - an inhibitor of Notch intercellular signalling - in mediating EMT and clusters formation of hybrid E/M cells. Knockdown of Numb in stable hybrid E/M cells H1975 results in a full EMT, thereby showing that Numb acts as a brake for a full EMT. Consistent with this observation, we show via a mathematical model that Numb inhibits a full EMT by stabilizing a hybrid E/M phenotype. Thus, Numb can behave as a  phenotypic stability factor by modulating Notch-driven EMT. By generalizing the mathematical model to a multi-cell level, Numb is predicted to alter the balance of hybrid E/M versus mesenchymal cells in clusters, potentially resulting in a higher tumour-initiation ability. Finally, Numb correlates with a poor survival in multiple independent lung and ovarian cancer datasets, hence confirming its relationship with increased cancer aggressiveness.\n\nMajor Findings: we adopt an integrative computational-experimental approach to identify that Numb, an inhibitor of Notch signalling, can stabilize a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype. We show that knockdown of Numb in H1975 cells that display a stable hybrid E/M state is sufficient to destabilize a hybrid E/M state and push them to a full EMT phenotype. Next, we develop a mechanism-based mathematical model that recapitulates this ability of Numb in maintaining a hybrid E/M state, and predicts that Numb can alter the relative frequency of hybrid E/M and mesenchymal cells at a tissue level or in clusters of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) - the primary drivers of metastasis. Finally, we show that across cancer types, Numb correlates with worse patient survival, thus reinforcing the emerging notion that a hybrid E/M, but not necessarily a completely mesenchymal, phenotype associates with elevated tumour progression.|10.1098/rsif.2017.0512|biorxiv

Here, we use biochemical and in situ approaches to identify the complex in which the capsid protein Gag first associates with gRNA, termed the packaging initiation complex. First, we show that in the absence of assembling Gag, non-nuclear non-translating gRNA is nearly absent from the soluble fraction of provirus-expressing cells, and is found instead primarily in complexes >30S. When we express a Gag mutant known to be arrested at packaging initiation, we find only one complex containing Gag and gRNA; thus, this complex corresponds to the packaging initiation complex. This [~]80S complex also contains two cellular facilitators of assembly, ABCE1 and the RNA granule protein DDX6, and therefore corresponds to a co-opted host RNA granule and a previously described capsid assembly intermediate. Additionally, we find this granule-derived packaging initiation complex in HIV-1-infected H9 T cells, and demonstrate that wild-type Gag forms both the packaging initiation complex and a larger granule-derived complex corresponding to a late packaging/assembly intermediate. We also demonstrate that packaging initiation complexes are far more numerous than P bodies in situ. Finally, we show that Gag enters the [~]80S granule to form the packaging initiation complex via a two-step mechanism. In a step that is independent of a gRNA-binding domain, Gag enters a broad class of RNA granules, most of which lack gRNA. In a second step that is dependent on the gRNA-binding nucleocapsid domain of Gag or a heterologous gRNA-binding domain, Gag enters a gRNA-containing subset of these granules. Thus, we conclude that packaging in cells does not result from random encounters between Gag and gRNA; instead our data support a fundamentally different model in which Gag is directed to gRNA within a unique host RNA granule to initiate this critical event in HIV-1 replication.\n\nNontechnical SummaryTo form infectious virus, the HIV-1 capsid protein Gag must associate with and package the viral genomic RNA (gRNA) during the virus assembly process.

Here we identify the packaging initiation complex, and demonstrate that it corresponds to a host RNA granule that is co-opted by the virus. RNA granules are diverse complexes utilized by host cells for all aspects of RNA storage and metabolism besides translation. Our study also defines the mechanism by which HIV-1 Gag enters this host RNA granule to form the packaging initiation complex, and reveal that it involves two steps that depend on different regions of Gag.

When done appropriately, independent replication of the entity-intervention pair contributes to the sample size (N) and forms the basis of statistical inference. However, sometimes the appropriate entity-intervention pair may not be obvious, and the wrong choice can make an experiment worthless. We surveyed a random sample of published animal experiments from 2011 to 2016 where interventions were applied to parents but effects examined in the offspring, as regulatory authorities have provided clear guidelines on replication with such designs. We found that only 22% of studies (95% CI = 17% to 29%) replicated the correct entity-intervention pair and thus made valid statistical inferences. Approximately half of the studies (46%, 95% CI = 38% to 53%) had pseudoreplication while 32% (95% CI = 26% to 39%) provided insufficient information to make a judgement. Pseudoreplication artificially inflates the sample size, leading to more false positive results and inflating the apparent evidence supporting a scientific claim. It is hard for science to advance when so many experiments are poorly designed and analysed. We argue that distinguishing between biological units, experimental units, and observational units clarifies where replication should occur, describe the criteria for genuine replication, and provide guidelines for designing and analysing in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments.|10.1371/journal.pbio.2005282|biorxiv

However, radiation-induced normal tissue toxicity is a major contributor to patients quality of life and often a dose-limiting factor in the definitive treatment of cancer with radiation therapy. We propose the next logical step in the evolution of IMRT using canonical radiobiological principles, optimizing the temporal dimension through which radiation therapy is delivered to further reduce radiation-induced toxicity by increased time for normal tissue recovery. We term this novel treatment planning strategy \""temporally feathered radiotherapy\"" (TFRT).\n\nMethodsTFRT plans were generated as a composite of five simulated treatment plans each with altered constraints on particular hypothetical organs at risk (OARs) to be delivered sequentially. For each of these TFRT plans, OARs chosen for feathering receive higher doses while the remaining OARs receive lower doses than the standard fractional dose delivered in a conventional fractionated IMRT plan. Each TFRT plan is delivered a specific weekday, which in effect leads to a higher dose once weekly followed by four lower fractional doses to each temporally feathered OAR. We compared normal tissue toxicity between TFRT and conventional fractionated IMRT plans by using a dynamical mathematical model to describe radiation-induced tissue damage and repair over time.\n\nResultsModel-based simulations of TFRT demonstrated potential for reduced normal tissue toxicity compared to conventionally planned IMRT. The sequencing of high and low fractional doses delivered to OARs by TFRT plans suggested increased normal tissue recovery, and hence less overall radiation-induced toxicity, despite higher total doses delivered to OARs compared to conventional fractionated IMRT plans. The magnitude of toxicity reduction by TFRT planning was found to depend on the corresponding standard fractional dose of IMRT and organ-specific recovery rate of sublethal radiation-induced damage.\n\nConclusionsTFRT is a novel technique for treatment planning and optimization of therapeutic radiotherapy that considers the non-linear aspects of tissue repair to optimize toxicity profiles. Model-based simulations of TFRT to carefully conceptualized clinical cases have demonstrated potential for normal tissue toxicity reduction in a previously described dynamical model of normal tissue complication probability (NTCP)."|10.1002/mp.12988|biorxiv
10.1101/183806|Neither pulled nor pushed: Genetic drift and front wandering uncover a new class of reaction-diffusion waves|Birzu, G.; Hallatschek, O.; Korolev, K. S.|Kirill S. Korolev|Boston University|2017-09-03|1|new results|cc_no|ecology|https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/03/183806.source.xml|Short AbstractTraveling waves describe diverse natural phenomena from crystal growth in physics to range expansions in biology. Two classes of waves exist with very different properties: pulled and pushed. Pulled waves are driven by high growth rates at the expansion edge, where the number of organisms is small and fluctuations are large. In contrast, fluctuations are suppressed in pushed waves because the region of maximal growth is shifted towards the population bulk. Although it is commonly believed that expansions are either pulled or pushed, we found an intermediate class of waves with bulk-driven growth, but exceedingly large fluctuations. These waves are unusual because their properties are controlled by both the leading edge and the bulk of the front.\n\nLong AbstractEpidemics, flame propagation, and cardiac rhythms are classic examples of reaction-diffusion waves that describe a switch from one alternative state to another. Only two types of waves are known: pulled, driven by the leading edge, and pushed, driven by the bulk of the wave. Here, we report a distinct class of semi-pushed waves for which both the bulk and the leading edge contribute to the dynamics. These hybrid waves have the kinetics of pushed waves, but exhibit giant fluctuations similar to pulled waves. The transitions between pulled, semi-pushed, and fully-pushed waves occur at universal ratios of the wave velocity to the Fisher velocity. We derive these results in the context of a species invading a new habitat by examining front diffusion, rate of diversity loss, and fluctuation-induced corrections to the expansion velocity. All three quantities decrease as a power law of the population density with the same exponent. We analytically calculate this exponent taking into account the fluctuations in the shape of the wave front. For fully-pushed waves, the exponent is -1 consistent with the central limit theorem. In semi-pushed waves, however, the fluctuations average out much more slowly, and the exponent approaches 0 towards the transition to pulled waves. As a result, a rapid loss of genetic diversity and large fluctuations in the position of the front occur even for populations with cooperative growth and other forms of an Allee effect. The evolutionary outcome of spatial spreading in such populations could therefore be less predictable than previously thought.|NA|biorxiv

We recently observed that GIGYF2 also interacts with the miRNA-induced silencing complex and modulates its translation repression activity. Here we have further investigated how GIGYF2 represses mRNA function. In RNA tethering reporter assays we show that GIGYF2 exerts its action through a combination of translational repression and stimulated mRNA decay. Using truncation variants we identify two distinct effector domains within GIGYF2. In this assay GIGYF2-mediated repression is independent of m4EHP but dependent on the deadenylation activity of the CCR4/NOT complex. We further show that GIGYF2 interacts with multiple subunits of the CCR4/NOT complex and interestingly depletion of the CNOT1 scaffold subunit does not affect GIGYF2-mediated repression. Finally, we identify endogenous mRNA targets of GIGYF2 that recapitulate m4EHP - independent repression. Altogether, we propose that GIGYF2 has two distinct mechanisms of repression: one depends on m4EHP binding and affects translation, the other is m4EHP-independent and relies on the deadenylation activity of the CCR4/NOT complex.|10.1093/nar/gky198|biorxiv

However, their integration remains challenging. Here, we delineate a general approach for data-driven and unbiased identification of key TFs and dynamic GRNs, called EPIC-DREM. We generated time-series transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles during differentiation of mouse multipotent bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) towards adipocytes and osteoblasts. Using our novel approach we constructed time-resolved GRNs for both lineages. To prioritize the identified shared regulators, we mapped dynamic super-enhancers in both lineages and associated them to target genes with correlated expression profiles. We identified aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and Glis family zinc finger 1 (GLIS1) as mesenchymal key TFs controlled by dynamic MSC-specific super-enhancers that become repressed in both lineages. AHR and GLIS1 control differentiation-induced genes and we propose they function as guardians of mesenchymal multipotency.|10.1093/nar/gky1240|biorxiv

In particular, microbial communities are assembled by deterministic (e.g., selection) and stochastic (e.g., dispersal) processes, and the relative influence of these two process types is hypothesized to alter the influence of microbial communities over biogeochemical function, which we define generically to represent any biogeochemical reaction of interest. We used an ecological simulation model to evaluate this hypothesis. We assembled receiving communities under different levels of dispersal from a source community that was assembled purely by deterministic selection. The dispersal scenarios ranged from no dispersal (i.e., selection-only) to dispersal rates high enough to overwhelm selection (i.e., homogenizing dispersal). We used an aggregate measure of community fitness to infer its biogeochemical function relative to other communities. We also used ecological null models to further link the relative influence of deterministic assembly to function. We found that increasing rates of dispersal decrease biogeochemical function by increasing the proportion of maladapted taxa in a local community. Niche breadth was also a key determinant of biogeochemical function, suggesting a tradeoff between the function of generalist and specialist species. Together, our results highlight the influence of spatial processes on biogeochemical function and indicate the need to account for such effects in models that aim to predict biogeochemical function under future environmental scenarios.|10.3390/pr5040065|biorxiv

However, paleogenomics research in these climates has been constrained so far by poor ancient DNA yields. Here we compare the performance of two DNA extraction methods on ancient samples of teeth and petrous portions excavated from tropical and semitropical sites in Tanzania, Mexico, and Puerto Rico (N=12).\n\nMaterials and MethodsAll samples were extracted twice, built into double-stranded sequencing libraries, and shotgun sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500. The first extraction protocol, Method D, was previously designed for recovery of ultrashort DNA fragments from skeletal remains. The second, Method H, modifies the first by adding an initial EDTA wash and an extended digestion and decalcification step.\n\nResultsNo significant difference was found in overall ancient DNA yields or post-mortem damage patterns recovered from samples extracted with either method, irrespective of tissue type. However, Method H samples had higher endogenous content and more mapped reads after quality-filtering, but also higher clonality. In contrast, samples extracted with Method D had shorter average DNA fragments.\n\nDiscussionBoth methods successfully recovered endogenous ancient DNA. But, since surviving DNA in ancient or historic remains from tropical contexts is extremely fragmented, our results suggest that Method D is the optimal choice for working with samples from warm and humid environments. Additional optimization of extraction conditions and further testing of Method H with different types of samples may allow for improvement of this protocol in the future.|10.1002/ajpa.23472|biorxiv

However, existing studies have sampled a limited subset of taxa, color traits, and developmental stages. To expand our sample of color loci, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping analyses on two types of larval pigmentation traits that vary among populations of the redheaded pine sawfly (Neodiprion lecontei): carotenoid-based yellow body color and melanin-based spotting pattern. For both traits, our QTL models explained a substantial proportion of phenotypic variation and suggested a genetic architecture that is neither monogenic nor highly polygenic. Additionally, we used our linkage map to anchor the current N. lecontei genome assembly. With these data, we identified promising candidate genes underlying: (1) a loss of yellow pigmentation in Mid-Atlantic/northeastern populations (Cameo2 and apoLTP-II/I), and (2) a pronounced reduction in black spotting in Great-Lakes populations (yellow, TH, Dat). Several of these genes also contribute to color variation in other wild and domesticated taxa. Overall, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that predictable genes of large-effect contribute to color evolution in nature.|10.1534/genetics.118.300793|biorxiv

Using matched whole-genome sequencing data, we attributed RNA alterations to germline and somatic DNA alterations, revealing likely genetic mechanisms. We identified 444 associations of gene expression with somatic non-coding single-nucleotide variants. We found 1,872 splicing alterations associated with somatic mutation in intronic regions, including novel exonization events associated with Alu elements. Somatic copy number alterations were the major driver of total gene and allele-specific expression (ASE) variation. Additionally, 82% of gene fusions had structural variant support, including 75 of a novel class called \""bridged\"" fusions, in which a third genomic location bridged two different genes. Globally, we observe transcriptomic alteration signatures that differ between cancer types and have associations with DNA mutational signatures. Given this unique dataset of RNA alterations, we also identified 1,012 genes significantly altered through both DNA and RNA mechanisms.

Propolis and its constituents have been subjected to many studies and are known for their antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic properties. In our study, antioxidant and antitumor capacity of propolis from Konya Sakyatan and Kiziloren regions were investigated. According to our result, Kzloren propolis sample possesses higher antioxidant component and antioxidant capacity than Sakyatan sample. Accordingly, Kiziloren sample showed antiproliferative effect at much lower doses compared to the Sakyatan sample. Both samples effectively inhibited the migration of cancer cells at their determined IC50 dosages. Obtained data indicates that constituents of propolis can greatly vary from one sample to another even in the same region and propolis selections for cancer prevention and treatment studies should be carefully considered.|NA|biorxiv

Understanding the way that access to palatable (high fat or high calorie) food can lead to overconsumption is essential for both preventing and treating obesity. Although the body of studies focused on the effects of high energy diets is growing, our understanding of how different factors contribute to food choices is not complete. In this study, we present a mathematical model that is able to predict rats calorie intake to a high-energy diet based on their ingestive behavior to a standard chow diet. Specifically, we propose an equation that describes the relation between the body weight (W), energy density (E), time elapsed from the start of diet (T), and daily calorie intake (C). We tested our model on two independent data sets. Our results show that the suggested model is able to predict the calorie intake patterns with high accuracy. Additionally, the only free parameter of our proposed equation ({rho}), which is unique to each animal, has a strong correlation with their calorie intake and weight gain. Additionally, we discuss the relevance of our derived parameter in the context of measuring reward sensitivity in reinforcement learning based studies.|10.1152/ajpregu.00337.2017|biorxiv

While few oppose data sharing philosophically, a range of barriers deter most researchers from implementing it in practice (e.g., workforce and infrastructural demands, sociocultural and privacy concerns, lack of standardization). To justify the significant effort required for sharing data (e.g., organization, curation, distribution), funding agencies, institutions, and investigators need clear evidence of benefit. Here, using the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative, we present a brain imaging case study that provides direct evidence of the impact of open sharing on data use and resulting publications over a seven-year period (2010-2017). We dispel the myth that scientific findings using shared data cannot be published in high-impact journals and demonstrate rapid growth in the publication of such journal articles, scholarly theses, and conference proceedings. In contrast to commonly used  pay to play models, we demonstrate that openly shared data can increase the scale (i.e., sample size) of scientific studies conducted by data contributors, and can recruit scientists from a broader range of disciplines. These findings suggest the transformative power of data sharing for accelerating science and underscore the need for the scientific ecosystem to embrace the challenge of implementing data sharing universally.|10.1038/s41467-018-04976-1|biorxiv

To get insights into these matters, we analyzed chemical reaction networks with different topologies and degrees of complexity, interacting or not with the environment. We showed that the global level of fluctuations at the steady state, as measured by the sum of the Fano factors of the number of molecules of all species, is directly related to the topology of the network. For systems with zero deficiency, this sum is constant and equal to the rank of the network. For higher deficiencies, we observed an increase or decrease of the fluctuation levels according to the values of the reaction fluxes that link internal species, multiplied by the associated stoichiometry. We showed that the noise is reduced when the fluxes all flow towards the species of higher complexity, whereas it is amplified when the fluxes are directed towards lower complexity species.\n\nPACS numbers: 02.50.Ey, 05.10.Gg, 05.40.Ca, 87.18.-h|10.1103/physreve.98.012137|biorxiv

Currently, cosine similarity and correlation coefficient are used as scoring functions of dynamic programming to calculate similarity between PSSMs. However, it is unclear that these functions are optimal for profile alignment methods. At least, by definition, these functions cannot capture non-linear relationships between profiles. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to discover a novel scoring function, which was more suitable for the profile comparison method than the existing ones. Firstly we implemented a new derivative free neural network by combining the conventional neural network with evolutionary strategy optimization method. Next, using the framework, the scoring function was optimized for aligning remote sequence pairs. Nepal, the pairwise profile aligner with the novel scoring function significantly improved both alignment sensitivity and precision, compared to aligners with the existing functions. Nepal improved alignment quality because of adaptation to remote sequence alignment and increasing the expressive power of similarity score. The novel scoring function can be realized using a simple matrix operation and easily incorporated into other aligners. With our scoring function, the performance of homology detection and/or multiple sequence alignment for remote homologous sequences would be further improved.|NA|biorxiv

The propensity to remodel in response to a mechanical stimulus is reflected in part by the lifetime of the membrane-cytoskeleton bonds upon application of a tensile loading rate. We measure the lifetime and force to rupture membrane-cytoskeleton linkages of a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell line, HN-31 by applying a tensile loading rate (< 60 pN/s) with a handle bound to a cell, while monitoring the displacement of the handle at 2 kHz after averaging. We observe the lifetime increases with loading rate, rf to a maximum after which it decreases with further increase in rf. This biphasic relationship appears insensitive to drugs that target microtubule assembly, but is no longer detectable, i.e., lifetime is independent of rf in cells with reduced active Rho-GTPases. The loading rate-time relationship resembles catch-slip behavior reported upon applying tensile loads to separate protein complexes. Under small loads the bonds catch to increase lifetimes, under larger loads their lifetime shortens and they dissociate in a slip-like manner. Our data conforms to a model that considers the membrane-cytoskeleton bonds exhibit a load-dependent conformational change and dissociate via two pathways. We also find the membrane-cytoskeleton linkages strengthen with stationary compressive load, FSC (|FSC| < 40 pN), and conclude this metastatic cell line responds to small mechanical stimuli by promoting cytoskeleton remodeling as evident by observing F-actin within the membrane nanotube (10 {micro}m length) formed after bond rupture."|NA|biorxiv

Malignant cells will have variations in their gene expression, copy numbers, and mutation even when coming from a single tumor. Single cell sequencing of tumor cells is of paramount importance for unmasking the underlying the tumor heterogeneity. However extracting features from the single cell genomic data coherent with the underlying biology is computationally challenging, given the extremely noisy and sparse nature of the data. Here we are proposing  Dhaka a variational autoencoder based single cell analysis tool to transform genomic data to a latent encoded feature space that is more efficient in differentiating between the hidden tumor subpopulations. This technique is generalized across different types of genomic data such as copy number variation from DNA sequencing and gene expression data from RNA sequencing. We have tested the method on two gene expression datasets having 4K to 6K tumor cells and two copy number variation datasets having 250 to 260 tumor cells. Analysis of the encoded feature space revealed sub-populations of cells bearing distinct genomic signatures and the evolutionary relationship between them, which other existing feature transformation methods like t-SNE and PCA fail to do.|10.1093/bioinformatics/btz095|biorxiv

The High Five cell line (Hi5), originally derived from T. ni ovaries, is often used for efficient expression of recombinant proteins. Here, we report a draft assembly of the 368.2 Mb T. ni genome, with 90.6% of all bases assigned to one of its 28 chromosomes and predicted 14,037 predicted protein-coding genes. Manual curation of gene families involved in chemoreception and detoxification reveals T. ni-specific gene expansions that may explain its widespread distribution and rapid adaptation to insecticides. Using male and female genome sequences, we define Z-linked and repeat-rich W-linked sequences. Transcriptome and small RNA data from T. ni thorax, ovary, testis, and Hi5 cells reveal distinct expression profiles for 295 microRNA- and >393 piRNA-producing loci, as well as 39 genes encoding core small RNA pathway proteins. siRNAs target both endogenous transposons and the exogenous TNCL virus. Surprisingly, T. ni siRNAs are not 2{acute}-O-methylated. Five piRNA-producing loci account for 34.9% piRNAs in the ovary, 49.3% piRNAs in the testis, and 44.0% piRNAs in Hi5 cells. Nearly all of the W chromosome is devoted to piRNA production: >76.0% of bases in the assembled W produce piRNAs in ovary. To enable use of the T. ni germline-derived Hi5 cell line as a model system, we have established efficient genome editing and single-cell cloning protocols. Taken together, the T. ni genome provides insights into pest control and allows Hi5 cells to become a new tool for studying small RNAs ex vivo.|10.7554/eLife.31628|biorxiv

However, at which extent brain-connectivity metrics reflect the age of an individual and whether treatments or lifestyle factors such as physical activity influence the age-connectivity match is still unclear. Here, we assessed the level of physical activity and collected brain images from healthy participants (N=155) ranging from 10 to 80 years to build functional (resting-state) and structural (tractography) connectivity matrices that were combined as connectivity descriptors. Connectivity descriptors were used to compute a maximum likelihood age estimator that was optimized by minimizing the mean absolute error. The connectivity-based estimated age, i.e. the brain-connectome age (BCA), was compared to the chronological age (ChA). Our results were threefold. First, we showed that ageing widely affects the structural-functional connectivity of multiple structures, such as the anterior part of the default mode network, basal ganglia, thalamus, insula, cingulum, hippocampus, parahippocampus, occipital cortex, fusiform, precuneus and temporal pole. Second, our analysis showed that the structure-function connectivity between basal ganglia and thalamus to orbitofrontal and frontal areas make a major contribution to age estimation. Third, we found that high levels of physical activity reduce BCA as compared to ChA, and vice versa, low levels increment it. In conclusion, the BCA model results highlight the impact of physical activity and the key role played by the connectivity between basal ganglia and thalamus to frontal areas on the process of healthy aging. Notably, the same methodology can be generally applied both to evaluate the impact of other factors and therapies on brain ageing, and to identify the structural-functional brain connectivity correlate of other biomarkers than ChA.|10.1002/hbm.24312|biorxiv

Compared with other noninvasive neuromodulation approaches, key technical advantages include high lateral resolution of stimulation and deep penetration depth. However, empirically observed effects in vivo are diverse; for example, variations in sonication location and waveform can alternatively elicit putatively inhibitory or excitatory effects. At a fundamental level, it is unclear how FUS alters the function of neural circuits at the site of sonication. To address this knowledge gap, we developed an approach to optically interrogate the spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity in the cortex directly at the acoustic focus, thereby offering a glimpse into the local effects of FUS on distributed populations of neurons in vivo. Our experiments probed electrical activity through the use of voltage sensitive dyes (VSDs) and, in transgenic GCaMP6f mice, monitored associated Ca2+ responses. Our results directly demonstrate that low-intensity FUS adjusts both the kinetics and spatial patterns of sensory receptive fields at the acoustic focus in vivo. Although our experimental configuration limits interpretation to population activity, the use of VSDs ensures that the detected alterations reflect activity in cortical neurons, unobscured by signals in subcortical or laterally distant cortical regions. More generally, this optical measurement paradigm can be implemented to observe FUS-induced alterations in cortical representation with higher lateral resolution spatial versatility than is practical through more conventional electrodebased measurements. Our findings suggest that reports of FUS-induced sensory modulation in human studies may partly reflect alterations cortical representation and reactivity.|10.1088/1741-2552/aaaee1|biorxiv

It is well known that violations of temporal structure within sequences of stimuli lead to neurophysiological effects known as the (temporal) mismatch negativity (TMMN). However, previous studies investigating this phenomenon have typically presented successive stimulus intervals (i.e., durations) within a rhythmic structure, conflating the contributions of rhythmic temporal processing with those specific to duration. In a novel behavioural paradigm which extends the classic temporal oddball design, we examined the neurophysiological correlates of prediction violation under both rhythmically (isochronous) and arrhythmically (anisochronous) presented durations, in visual and auditory modalities. Using event-related potential (ERP), multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), and temporal generalisation analysis (TGA) analyses, we found evidence for common, and distinct neurophysiological responses related to duration predictions and their violation, across isochronous and anisochronous conditions. Further, using TGA we could directly compare processes underlying duration prediction violation across different modalities, despite differences in processing latency of audition and vision. We discovered a common set of neurophysiological responses that are elicited whenever a duration prediction is violated, regardless of presentation modality, indicating the existence of a supramodal duration prediction mechanism. Altogether, our data show that the human brain encodes predictions specifically about duration, in addition to those from rhythmic structure, and that the neural underpinnings of these predictions generalize across modalities. These findings support the idea that time perception is based on similar principles of inference as characterize  predictive processing theories of perception.|NA|biorxiv

Children born to exposed mothers are at highest risk of learning and memory and motor deficits. We developed a mouse model that mimics human variation in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) to determine if genetic variation increases susceptibility to developmental PCB exposure. In our previous studies, we found that high-affinity AhrbCyp1a2(-/-) and poor-affinity AhrdCyp1a2(-/-) knockout mice were most susceptible to learning and memory deficits following developmental PCB exposure compared with AhrbCyp1a2(+/+) wild type mice (C57BL/6J strain). Our follow-up studies focused on motor deficits, because human studies have identified PCBs as a potential risk factor for Parkinsons disease. Dams were treated with an environmentally relevant PCB mixture at gestational day 10 and postnatal day 5. We used a motor battery that included tests of nigrostriatal function as well as cerebellar function, because PCBs deplete thyroid hormone, which is essential to normal cerebellar development. There was a significant effect of PCB treatment in the rotarod test with impaired performance in all three genotypes, but decreased motor learning as well in the two Cyp1a2(-/-) knockout lines. Interestingly, we found a main effect of genotype with corn oil-treated control Cyp1a2(-/-) mice performing significantly worse than Cyp1a2(+/+) wild type mice. In contrast, we found that PCB-treated high-affinity Ahrb mice were most susceptible to disruption of nigrostriatal function with the greatest deficits in AhrbCyp1a2(-/-) mice. We conclude that differences in both genes affect susceptibility to motor deficits following developmental PCB exposure.|10.1016/j.neuro.2018.01.008|biorxiv

Analyzing the sensitivity of detecting genomic mutations in HTS requires comprehensive profiling of sequencing artifacts. To this end, we introduce MERIT, designed for in-depth quantification of erroneous substitutions and small insertions and deletions, specifically for ultra-deep applications. MERIT incorporates an all-inclusive variant caller and considers genomic context, including the nucleotides immediately at 5' and 3', thereby establishing error rates for 96 possible substitutions as well as four singlebase and 16 double-base indels. We apply MERIT to ultra-deep sequencing data (1,300,000x) and show a significant relationship between error rates and genomic contexts. We devise an in silico approach to determine the optimal sequencing depth, where errors occur at rates similar to those of true mutations. Finally, we assess nucleotide-incorporation fidelity of four high-fidelity DNA polymerases in clinically relevant loci, and demonstrate how fixed detection thresholds may result in substantial false positive as well as false negative calls.|10.1186/s12859-018-2223-1|biorxiv

We demonstrate that this method performs best when the sets under consideration are of similar size and the performance degrades considerably when the sets are of very different size. We introduce a new and efficient approach, called the containment min hash approach, that is more suitable for estimating the Jaccard index of sets of very different size. We accomplish this by leveraging another probabilistic method (in particular, Bloom filters) for fast membership queries. We derive bounds on the probability of estimate errors for the containment min hash approach and show it significantly improves upon the classical min hash approach. We also show significant improvements in terms of time and space complexity. As an application, we use this method to detect the presence/absence of organisms in a metagenomic data set, showing that it can detect the presence of very small, low abundance microorganisms.|NA|biorxiv

Baf60c (Smarcd3) encodes a cardiac-enriched subunit of the SWI/SNF-like BAF chromatin complex. Its role throughout heart development is not fully understood. We show that constitutive loss of Baf60c leads to embryonic cardiac hypoplasia and pronounced cardiac dysfunction. Conditional deletion of Baf60c in cardiomyocytes results in postnatal dilated cardiomyopathy with impaired contractile function. Baf60c regulates a gene expression program that includes genes encoding contractile proteins, modulators of sarcomere function, and cardiac metabolic genes. Many of the genes deregulated in Baf60c null embryos are targets of the MEF2/SRF co-factor Myocardin (MYOCD). In a yeast two-hybrid screen we identify MYOCD as a BAF60c interacting factor; we show that BAF60c and MYOCD directly and functionally interact.

Whether codon usage is also generally shaped by natural selection in large organisms, despite their relatively small effective population size (Ne), is unclear. Codon usage bias in animals has only been studied in a handful of model organisms so far, and can be affected by confounding, non-adaptive processes such as GC-biased gene conversion and experimental artefacts. Using population transcriptomics data we analysed the relationship between codon usage, gene expression, allele frequency distribution and recombination rate in 31 non-model species of animals, each from a different family, covering a wide range of effective population sizes. We disentangled the effects of translational selection and GC-biased gene conversion on codon usage by separately analysing GC-conservative and GC-changing mutations. We report evidence for effective translational selection on codon usage in large-Ne species of animals, but not in small-Ne ones, in agreement with the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution. C- and T-ending codons are generally preferred over synonymous G- and A-ending ones, for reasons that remain to be determined. In contrast, we uncovered a conspicuous effect of GC-biased gene conversion, which is widespread in animals and the main force determining the fate of AT{leftrightarrow}GC mutations.

Cortical infarcts are observed in as many as 30% of cryptococcal meningitis cases, being particularly common in severe infection. Limited clinical case studies suggest infarcts are secondary to vasculitis and blood vessel damage caused by cryptococcal infection. However, the cause of infarcts in cryptococcal infection has not been determined. To examine potential causes of vascular damage and cryptococcal dissemination in cryptococcal infection, the zebrafish C. neoformans infection model was used. We demonstrate that spread of cryptococci from the vasculature occurs at sites where cryptococci grow within the blood vessels, originating from a single or small number of cryptococci. We find that cryptococcal cells become trapped within the vasculature and can proliferate there resulting in vasodilation. Localised cryptococcal growth in the vasculature is also associated with sites of dissemination - in some cases simultaneously with a loss of blood vessel integrity. Using a cell-cell junction protein reporter (VE-cadherin) we identified sites dissemination associated with both intact blood vessels and where vessel rupture occurred. Thus, we have identified a mechanism for blood vessel damage during cryptococcal infection that may represent a cause of the vascular damage and cortical infarction observed in cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nAuthor summaryHuman infection by the fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, can lead to life-threatening cryptococcal meningitis. In severe cases of cryptococcal meningitis, a lack of blood supply can cause tissue death and a resulting area of dead tissue (infarct) in the brain. Although vasculature inflammation in known to occur in cryptococcal meningitis, the cause of infarcts in unknown. Using a zebrafish model of cryptococcal infection, the growth and dissemination of fungal cells was observed over time. We show that cryptococcal cells become trapped and proliferate in the vasculature, resulting in cryptococcoma that damage the blood vessels. We propose that vessel damage results from increased blood pressure caused by cryptococci blocking blood vessels suggesting that the vascular damage that ensues on cryptococcoma formation may in turn be a cause of infarct formation seen in cryptococcal meningitis.|NA|biorxiv

Most of these algorithms need labelled data to learn a model for the task at hand. Despite the recent release of a few plant phenotyping datasets, large annotated plant image datasets for the purpose of training deep learning algorithms are lacking. One common approach to alleviate the lack of training data is dataset augmentation. Herein, we propose an alternative solution to dataset augmentation for plant phenotyping, creating artificial images of plants using generative neural networks. We propose the Arabidopsis Rosette Image Generator (through) Adversarial Network: a deep convolutional network that is able to generate synthetic rosette-shaped plants, inspired by DC-GAN (a recent adversarial network model using convolutional layers). Specifically, we trained the network using A1, A2, and A4 of the CVPPP 2017 LCC dataset, containing Arabidopsis Thaliana plants. We show that our model is able to generate realistic 128 x 128 colour images of plants. We train our network conditioning on leaf count, such that it is possible to generate plants with a given number of leaves suitable, among others, for training regression based models. We propose a new Ax dataset of artificial plants images, obtained by our ARIGAN. We evaluate this new dataset using a state-of-the-art leaf counting algorithm, showing that the testing error is reduced when Ax is used as part of the training data.|NA|biorxiv

Here, we propose and validate the alternative hypothesis that anticipatory control can be realized through a cascade of purely sensory predictions that drive the motor system, reflecting the causal sequence of the perceptual events preceding the error. We compare both hypotheses in a simulated anticipatory postural adjustment task. We observe that adaptation in the sensory domain, but not in the motor one, supports the robust and generalizable anticipatory control characteristic of biological systems. Our proposal unites the neurobiology of the cerebellum with the theory of active inference and provides a concrete implementation of its core tenets with great relevance both to our understanding of biological control systems and, possibly, to their emulation in complex artefacts.|10.1098/rspb.2017.1780|biorxiv

A central question of how brains keep track of time is how specific temporal information across different sensory modalities is. In the present study, we show that encoding of temporal intervals in auditory and visual modalities are qualitatively similar. Human participants were instructed to reproduce intervals in the range from 750 ms to 1500 ms marked by auditory or visual stimuli. Our behavioural results suggest that, although participants were more accurate in reproducing intervals marked by auditory stimuli, there was a strong correlation in performance between modalities. Using multivariate pattern analysis in scalp EEG, we show that activity during late periods of the intervals was similar within and between modalities. Critically, we show that a multivariate pattern classifier was able to accurately predict the elapsed interval, even when trained on an interval marked by a stimulus of a different sensory modality. Taken together, our results suggest that, while there are differences in the processing of intervals marked by auditory and visual stimuli, they also share a common neural representation.|10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.08.014|biorxiv

It is readily observed when emotional and neutral scenes are encoded and recalled together, in a  mixed list, but diminishes when these scenes are encoded separately, in  pure lists. We examined the hypothesis that this effect is due to differences of allocation of attention to neutral stimuli according to whether they are presented in mixed or pure lists, especially when encoding is intentional. Using picture stimuli that were controlled for semantic relatedness, our results contradicted this hypothesis. The amplitude of well-known electrophysiological markers of emotion-related attention - the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN), the Late Positive Potential (LPP), and the Slow Wave (SW) - was higher for emotional stimuli. Crucially, the emotional modulation of these ERPs was insensitive to list context, observed equally in pure and mixed lists. Although list context did not modulate neural markers of emotion-related attention, list context did modulate the effect of emotion on free recall. The apparent decoupling of the emotional effects on attention and memory challenges existing hypotheses accounting for the emotional enhancement of memory. We close by discussing whether findings are more compatible with an alternative hypothesis, where the magnitude of emotional memory enhancement is, at least in part, a consequence of retrieval dynamics.|10.1111/psyp.13014|biorxiv

Yet, these developments remain largely unexplored in plants. We present Neighbor Counting Ensemble, a gene function prediction method which integrates eleven gene co-function networks for Arabidopsis thaliana, and produces more accurate gene function predictions for a larger fraction of genes with unknown function. We used these predictions to identify genes involved in mitochondrial complex I formation, and for five of them we confirmed the predictions experimentally.

Flowers consumed by florivores may fail to produce fruit or produce lower seed set because of direct damage to reproductive organs. In addition, eaten flowers are less attractive to pollinators because of reduced or modified advertisement, which reduces pollination services. While observational data are abundant, experimental evidence is scarce and results are contrasting. We tested experimentally the effect of florivory on both pollinator visitation and reproductive success in three species of the Royal Irises, which have large flowers that are attractive to pollinators, and potentially also for florivores. We hypothesized that florivory will reduce pollen deposition due to reduced attractiveness to pollinators, while fruit set and seed set will depend on the extent of florivory. We performed artificial florivory in two experiments over two years. In the first experiment, each of the three floral units of a single Iris flower was subject to either low or high artificial florivory, or left un-touched as control. We counted the number of pollen grains deposited on each of the three stigmas as a measure of pollinator visitation. In the second experiment, three flowers of the same plant received low, high, or no artificial florivory and were further recorded for fruit and seed production. In 2016, high artificial florivory revealed lower number of pollen grains on stigmas of Iris atropurpurea, but in 2017 there was no difference. Similarly, number of pollen grains in high artificial was lower than low florivory in 2017 in I. petrana. No significant effect of florivory was found on pollen grain deposition, fruit set or seed set. The results remained consistent across species and across years. The results undermine the assumption that flower herbivory is necessarily antagonistic interaction and suggests that florivores may not be strong selection agents on floral reproductive biology in the Oncocyclus irises.|NA|biorxiv

In particular, the physical clustering of functionally related genes can facilitate coordinated gene expression and can prevent the breakup of co-adapted alleles in recombining populations. While clustering may thus result from selection for phenotype optimization and persistence, the extent to which eukaryotic gene organization in particular is driven by specific environmental selection pressures has rarely been systematically explored. Here, we investigated the genetic architecture of fungal genes involved in the degradation of phenylpropanoids, a class of plant-produced secondary metabolites that mediate many ecological interactions between plants and fungi. Using a novel gene cluster detection method, we identified over one thousand gene clusters, as well as many conserved combinations of clusters, in a phylogenetically and ecologically diverse set of fungal genomes. We demonstrate that congruence in gene organization over small spatial scales in fungal genomes is often associated with similarities in ecological lifestyle. Additionally, we find that while clusters are often structured as independent modules with little overlap in content, certain gene families merge multiple modules in a common network, suggesting they are important components of phenylpropanoid degradation strategies. Together, our results suggest that phenylpropanoids have repeatedly selected for gene clustering in fungi, and highlight the interplay between gene organization and ecological evolution in this ancient eukaryotic lineage.|10.1038/s41396-018-0075-3|biorxiv

Although the TATA-Binding Protein (TBP) subunit of TFIID is necessary and sufficient for in vitro transcription, the TBP-Associated Factor (TAF) subunits recognize downstream promoter elements, act as co-activators, and interact with nucleosomes. Here we show that transcription induces stable TAF binding to downstream promoter DNA, independent of upstream contacts, TBP, or other basal transcription factors. This transcription-dependent TAF complex promotes subsequent activator-independent transcription, and promoter response to TAF mutations in vivo correlates with the level of downstream, rather than overall, Taf1 crosslinking. We propose a new model in which TAFs function as reinitiation factors, accounting for the differential responses of promoters to various transcription factor mutations.|10.1101/gad.306324.117|biorxiv

Current understanding of vein development in leaves is based on the canalization of auxin into self-reinforcing streams which determine the sites of vascular cell differentiation. However, the role of auxin biosynthesis during leaf development in the context of leaf vein patterning has not been much studied so far. Here we characterize the context specific importance of auxin biosynthesis, auxin transport and mechanical regulations in a growing leaf. We show that domains of auxin biosynthesis predict the positioning of vascular cells. In mutants that have reduced capacity in auxin biosynthesis, leaf vein formation is decreased. While exogenous application of auxin does not compensate the loss of vein formation in auxin biosynthesis mutants, inhibition of polar auxin transport does compensate the vein-less phenotype, suggesting that the site-specific accumulation of auxin, which is likely to be mainly caused by the local auxin biosynthesis, is important for leaf vein formation. Our computational model of midvein development brings forth the interplay of cell stiffness and auxin dependent cell division. We propose that local auxin biosynthesis has the integral role in leaf vascular development.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBuilt spatially and temporally resolved auxin biosynthesis map in growing leaf primordium of Arabidopsis.\nC_LIO_LIExpression domains of auxin biosynthetic enzymes within primordia strongly correlated with leaf vein initiation.\nC_LIO_LIResults show that domains of auxin biosynthesis within primordia drive leaf vein initiation and patterning.\nC_LI\n\nHighlights and eTOC BlurbUsing modelling and a spatiotemporal analysis of auxin biosynthesis and transport, Kneuper et al. show that tissue specific auxin biosynthesis defines places of vein initiation hence underlining the importance of auxin concentration in vein initiation.|NA|biorxiv

The phenotypic variation found in organismal development is biased towards certain phenotypes, but the molecular mechanisms behind such restrictions are still poorly understood. Gene regulatory networks have been proposed as one cause of constrained phenotypic variation. However, most of the evidence for this is theoretical rather than experimental. Here, we study evolutionary biases in two synthetic gene regulatory circuits expressed in E. coli that produce a gene expression stripe - a pivotal pattern in embryonic development. The two parental circuits produce the same phenotype, but create it through different regulatory mechanisms. We show that mutations cause distinct novel phenotypes in the two networks and use a combination of experimental measurements, mathematical modelling and DNA sequencing to understand why mutations bring forth only some but not other novel gene expression phenotypes. Our results reveal that the regulatory mechanisms of networks restrict the possible phenotypic variation upon mutation. Consequently, seemingly equivalent networks can indeed be distinct in how they constrain the outcome of further evolution.|10.15252/msb.20178102|biorxiv

We identified a strikingly divergent genetic signature for the Ies6 subunit module that links the INO80 complex to metabolic homeostasis, including mitochondrial maintenance. INO80 is also needed to communicate TORC1-mediated signaling to chromatin and maintains histone acetylation at TORC1-responsive genes. Furthermore, computational analysis reveals subunits of INO80 and mTORC1 have high co-occurrence of alterations in human cancers.

All epilepsy patients exhibited significant deviations in NSE levels through time, and 4 of the epilepsy patients exhibited large sample entropy values and large signal variation metrics for NSE relative to S100{beta}. Controls did not exhibit such changes. Correlation analysis revealed that NSE levels were significantly elevated after clinical seizure events. There was also a highly significant relationship between increased EEG spike frequency and an increase in serum NSE levels measured 24 hours later. The detection of large but transient post-ictal increases in NSE suggests that even self-limited seizures may cause an injury to neurons that underlies cognitive decline in some patients.

To determine how often artificial selection for domestication traits in the grasses targeted orthologous genes, we employed resequencing data from wild and domesticated accessions of Zea (maize) and Sorghum (sorghum). Many \""classic\"" domestication genes identified through QTL mapping in populations resulting from wild/domesticated crosses indeed show signatures of parallel selection in both maize and sorghum. However, the overall number of genes showing signatures of parallel selection in both species is not significantly different from that expected by chance.

One hypothesis is that GBM mediates phenotypic plasticity. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed whole-genome methylation and transcriptome profiling on reciprocally transplanted colony fragments of the reef-building coral Acropora millepora. GBM was only slightly affected by transplantation but these small changes correlated with coral fitness in the new environment. Specifically, for transplanted corals, similarity in GBM patterns to native corals positively correlated with growth rate, as well as carbohydrate, protein, lipid and endosymbiont content. Between populations, elevated GBM positively correlated with transcription, supporting previous findings that GBM is associated with stable and active transcription. Contrary to expectations however, changes in transcription as a result of transplantation did not correlate with changes in GBM and did not predict fitness. This indicates that on physiological time scales GBM is not directly coupled to transcription, leaving open the question about the mechanism linking GBM to fitness during acclimatization.|NA|biorxiv

Previous documents imply that estrogen and miR-221 may be involved in IDD. This study further investigated their regulatory mechanisms underlying IDD. Normal and degenerated cartilaginous endplates (CEP) tissues were isolated surgically from juvenile patients with idiopathic scoliosis and adult patients with IDD, respectively. PCR and western blot assays showed decreased aggrecan, Col2A1, TGF-{beta} and estrogen receptor (ER) levels in CEP, but increased MMP-3, adamts-5, IL-1{beta}, TNF-, IL-6 and miR-221 levels. CEP cells were harvested from degenerated CEP tissues and treated with doses of 17{beta}-E2. 17{beta}-E2 increased expression of aggrecan and Col2A1 levels in endplate chondrocytes and secretion of TGF-{beta}, but decreased IL-6 secretion. Moreover, 17{beta}-E2 inhibited the apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in G0/G1, improving the cell viability. These data indicated estrogen confers protective effect against IDD. However, we found that ER was a target of miR-221 via luciferase assay. miR-221 up-regulation via the mimics or ER knockdown attenuated these protective effects conferred by estrogen, while intervention of miR-221 via the inhibitors promoted the protective effects. This study provided novel evidence that estrogen confers protective effects of CEP against IDD, however, up-regulated miR-221 in degenerated CEP decreased the protective effects via targeting ER, thus it may be an important cause for IDD.|10.1093/abbs/gmy017|biorxiv

However, the impact of metabolic changes on the differentiation of helper T cell subsets remains unclear. We found that TCR-mediated activation of glutamine metabolism regulates Th2 cell differentiation via the supplementation of -ketogulutalate (-KG) and histone H3K27 demethylation. Deprivation of glutamine or pharmacological inhibition of glutamine metabolism blocks the induction of Th2 cell differentiation without affecting Stat6 phosphorylation. The methylation status of H3K27 at the Th2 cytokine gene locus was significantly increased in Th2 cells cultured under glutamine-deprived conditions. The inhibitory effect of glutamine-deprivation was antagonized by -KG, and the -KG-dependent induction of Th2 cell differentiation was reduced in utx- and jmjd3-deficient naive CD4 T cells. These findings show that the glutamine-a-ketoglutarate axis is crucial to regulating the epigenetic status at the Th2 cytokine gene locus and subsequent Th2 cell differentiation.|NA|biorxiv

To date, synthetic biological feedback circuits have relied upon protein-based, transcriptional regulation to control circuit output. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules which can inhibit translation of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). In this paper, we designed, modelled and built two synthetic negative feedback circuits that use rationally-designed sRNAs for the first time. The first circuit builds upon the well characterised tet-based autorepressor, incorporating an externally-inducible sRNA to tune the effective feedback strength. This allows more precise fine-tuning of the circuit output in contrast to the sigmoidal input-output response of the autorepressor alone. In the second circuit, the output is a transcription factor that induces expression of an sRNA which negatively regulates the translation of the mRNA encoding this output, creating direct, closed-loop, negative feedback. Analysis of the noise profiles of both circuits showed that the use of sRNAs did not result in large increases in noise. Stochastic and deterministic modelling of both circuits agreed well with experimental data. Finally, simulations using fitted parameters allowed dynamic attributes of each circuit such as response time and disturbance rejection to be investigated.|10.1093/nar/gky828|biorxiv

The three-dimensional chromatin organisation is mediated by protein bridges, or \""readers\"", such as Polycomb Repressive Complexes and Transcription Factors. The coupling between readers and writers drives spreading of biochemical marks and sustains the memory of local chromatin states across replication and mitosis.

Strikingly, we demonstrate that GBM alone can explain the full distribution of Polycomb marks in a whole Drosophila chromosome.

This problem is often called the segmentation problem in the field of genomics, and the change-point problem in other scientific disciplines. Despite dozens of algorithms developed to address this problem in genomics research, methods with improved accuracy and speed are still needed to effectively tackle both existing and emerging genomic and epigenomic segmentation problems.\n\nResultsWe designed an efficient algorithm, called iSeg, for segmentation of genomic and epigenomic profiles. iSeg first utilizes dynamic programming to identify candidate segments and test for significance. It then uses a novel data structure based on two coupled balanced binary trees to detect overlapping significant segments and update them simultaneously during searching and refinement stages.

This problem is often called the segmentation problem in the field of genomics, and the change-point problem in other scientific disciplines. Despite dozens of algorithms developed to address this problem in genomics research, methods with improved accuracy and speed are still needed to effectively tackle both existing and emerging genomic and epigenomic segmentation problems.\n\nResultsWe designed an efficient algorithm, called iSeg, for segmentation of genomic and epigenomic profiles. iSeg first utilizes dynamic programming to identify candidate segments and test for significance. It then uses a novel data structure based on two coupled balanced binary trees to detect overlapping significant segments and update them simultaneously during searching and refinement stages. Refinement and merging of significant segments are performed at the end to generate the final set of segments. By using an objective function based on the p-values of the segments, the algorithm can serve as a general computational framework to be combined with different assumptions on the distributions of the data.

As a leading model organism with small genome size and great biotechnological importance, the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has many isolates currently being sequenced with long reads. However, analyzing long-read sequencing data to produce high-quality genome assembly and annotation remains challenging. Here we present LRSDAY, the first one-stop solution to streamline this process. LRSDAY can produce chromosome-level end-to-end genome assembly and comprehensive annotations for various genomic features (including centromeres, protein-coding genes, tRNAs, transposable elements and telomere-associated elements) that are ready for downstream analysis. Although tailored for S. cerevisiae, we designed LRSDAY to be highly modular and customizable, making it adaptable for virtually any eukaryotic organisms. Applying LRSDAY to a S. cerevisiae strain takes [~]43 hrs to generate a complete and well-annotated genome from [~]100X Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) reads using four threads.|10.1038/nprot.2018.025|biorxiv

To our knowledge, all the approaches developed so far for detecting such shifts from a quantitative character strongly involved stochastic models of evolution.\n\nWe propose here a novel method based on an asymmetric version of the linear parsimony (aka Wagner parsimony) for identifying the most parsimonious split of a tree into two parts between which the evolution of the character is allowed to differ. To this end, we evaluate the cost of splitting a phylogenetic tree at a given node as the integral, over all pairs of asymmetry parameters, of the most parsimonious cost which can be achieved by using the first parameter on the subtree pending from this node and the second parameter elsewhere. By testing all the nodes, we then get the most parsimonious split of a tree with regard to the character values at its tips.\n\nA study of the partial costs of the tree enabled us to develop a polynomial algorithm for determining the most parsimonious splits and their evolutionary costs. Applying this algorithm on two toy examples shows that using more than one asymmetry parameter does not always lower parsimonious costs. By using the approach on biological datasets, we obtained splits consistent with those identified by previous stochastic approaches.|NA|biorxiv

This applies to plants and animals with limited dispersal ability, to colonies of microbes in biofilms, and to other genetically heterogeneous aggregates of cells, such as cancerous tumors. The spatial structure of such populations leads to greater relatedness among proximate individuals while increasing the genetic divergence between distant individuals. In this study, we analyze a Moran coa-lescent in a one-dimensional spatial model where a randomly selected individual dies and is replaced by the progeny of an adjacent neighbor in every generation. We derive a recursive system of equations using the spatial distance among haplotypes as a state variable to compute coalescent probabilities and coalescent times. The coalescent probabilities near the branch termini are smaller than in the unstructured Moran model (except for t = 1, where they are equal), corresponding to longer branch lengths and greater expected pairwise coalescent times. The lower terminal coalescent probabilities result from a spatial separation of lineages, i.e. a coalescent event between a haplotype and its neighbor in one spatial direction at time t cannot co-occur with a coalescent event with a haplotype in the opposite direction at t + 1. The concomitant increased pairwise genetic distance among randomly sampled haplotypes in spatially constrained populations could lead to incorrect inferences of recent diversifying selection or of population bottlenecks when analyzed using an unconstrained coalescent model as a null hypothesis.|NA|biorxiv

The synchrony was linked to single-unit spiking and exhibited specific directionality between input and output measures in each region. Although it was correlated with the development of conditioned responses, it declined once the association stabilized. The results suggest that amygdala spikes aid to synchronize ACC activity and transfer error-signal information to support memory formation.\n\nHighlightsO_LITone-odor conditioning induces theta phase-reset in primate amygdala and dACC\nC_LIO_LIA directional phase-locking develops between amygdala spikes and dACC Theta\nC_LIO_LIInformation transfer from Amygdala to dACC decreases once memory stabilizes\nC_LI|10.1016/j.neuron.2017.11.042|biorxiv

In the work there was investigated the biological influence of extracts of cryopreserved fragments of skin and heart of newborn piglets with the cold wound of skin and myocardial ischemia in rats respectively. For investigations the extracts were obtained from cryopreserved fragments of newborn piglets skin and heart. Cold wound of skin was modelled in rats by 10 mm copper applicator cooled in liquid nitrogen down to -196{degrees}C; the areas of wounds were determined by planimetric method, the white blood cells counts were analysed. In rats with myocardial ischemia there were studied the electrocardiograms, heart rate variability and proliferative activity of heart cells. The injection of extracts of cryopreserved fragments of skin to the animals abdominal cavity accelerates the healing of cold wound of skin and normalizes the response of immune system to an injury. After the injection during 2 months to the animals with myocardial ischemia with extracts of cryopreserved fragments of heart the normalization of electrophysiological indices of heart activity was observed that testified about the improved blood supply to a heart muscle. Being injected to healthy animals and those with myocardial ischemia the extracts of cryopreserved fragments of heart resulted in an increase in proliferative activity of heart cells. The studied extracts have a high biological effect and can be applied when designing the drugs for regenerative medicine.\n\nSummary statementThe extracts of cryopreserved fragments of piglets heart or skin were shown as stimulating reparative regeneration of heart tissues in myocardial ischemia of rats and skin in a cold wound, respectively.|NA|biorxiv

Previous genome-wide association studies7-12 (GWAS) reported 16 genomic loci10-12. Here we report the largest neuroticism GWAS meta-analysis to date (N=449,484), and identify 136 independent genome-wide significant loci (124 novel), implicating 599 genes. Extensive functional follow-up analyses show enrichment in several brain regions and involvement of specific cell-types, including dopaminergic neuroblasts (P=3x10-8), medium spiny neurons (P=4x10-8) and serotonergic neurons (P=1x10-7). Gene-set analyses implicate three specific pathways: neurogenesis (P=4.4x10-9), behavioural response to cocaine processes (P=1.84x10-7), and axon part (P=5.26x10-8). We show that neuroticisms genetic signal partly originates in two genetically distinguishable subclusters13 (depressed affect and worry, the former being genetically strongly related to depression, rg=0.84), suggesting distinct causal mechanisms for subtypes of individuals.

Understanding the genetic basis of these phenotypes can lead to better tools to treat patients or detect reservoirs. To identify human genetic factors that contribute to symptoms diversity, we examined the range of disease severities caused by the parasite T. b. gambiense, the primary cause of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). We analyzed the transcriptomes of immune cells from both symptomatic HAT cases and individuals with latent infections. Our analysis identified several genes and pathways that associated with the latent phenotype, primarily suggesting increased T and B cell activation in HAT patients relative to latent infections. We also used these transcriptome data to conduct an exome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association study. This suggested that SNPs in the human major histocompatibility locus (HLA) associate with severity, supporting the transcription data and suggesting that T cell activation is a determining factor in outcome. Finally, to establish if T cell activation controls disease severity, we blocked co-stimulatory dependent T cell activation in an animal model for HAT. This showed that reducing T cell activation during trypanosome infection improves symptoms and reduces parasitemia. Our data has used a combination of transcriptome-wide analysis and an in vivo model to reveal that T cell activation and the HLA locus associate with the development of symptoms during HAT. This may open new avenues for the development of new therapeutics and prognostics.|NA|biorxiv

A prerequisite for a direct functional comparison is consistent annotation of the genetic elements with evidence statements. However, the current format provides limited support for data mining, hampering comparative analyses at large scale.\n\nResultsThe provenance of a genome annotation describes the contextual details and derivation history of the process that resulted in the annotation. To enable interoperability of genome annotations, we have developed the Genome Biology Ontology Language (GBOL) and associated infrastructure (GBOL stack). GBOL is provenance aware and thus provides a consistent representation of functional genome annotations linked to the provenance. GBOL is modular in design, extendible and linked to existing ontologies. The GBOL stack of supporting tools enforces consistency within and between the GBOL definitions in the ontology (OWL) and the Shape Expressions (ShEx) language describing the graph structure. Modules have been developed to serialize the linked data (RDF) and to generate a plain text format files.\n\nConclusionThe main rationale for applying formalized information models is to improve the exchange of information. GBOL uses and extends current ontologies to provide a formal representation of genomic entities, along with their properties and relations. The deliberate integration of data provenance in the ontology enables review of automatically obtained genome annotations at a large scale. The GBOL stack facilitates consistent usage of the ontology.|NA|biorxiv

The past decade has witnessed rapid advances in genomic tools for delineating 3D genome architecture. Among them, chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based methods such as Hi-C are the most widely used techniques for mapping chromatin interactions. However, traditional Hi-C protocols rely on restriction enzymes (REs) to fragment chromatin and are therefore limited in resolution. We recently developed DNase Hi-C for mapping 3D genome organization, which uses DNase I for chromatin fragmentation. DNase Hi-C overcomes RE-related limitations associated with traditional Hi-C methods, leading to improved methodological resolution. Furthermore, combining this method with DNA capture technology provides a high-throughput approach (targeted DNase Hi-C) that allows for mapping fine-scale chromatin architecture at exceptionally high resolution. Hence, targeted DNase Hi-C will be valuable for delineating the physical landscapes of cis-regulatory networks that control gene expression and for characterizing phenotype-associated chromatin 3D signatures. Here, we provide a detailed description of method design and step-by-step working protocols for these two methods.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDNase Hi-C, a method for comprehensive mapping of chromatin contacts on a whole-genome scale, is based on random chromatin fragmentation by DNase I digestion instead of sequence-specific restriction enzyme (RE) digestion.\nC_LIO_LITargeted DNase Hi-C, which combines DNase Hi-C with DNA capture technology, is a high-throughput method for mapping fine-scale chromatin architecture of genomic loci of interest at a resolution comparable to that of genomic annotations of functional elements.\nC_LIO_LIDNase Hi-C and targeted DNase Hi-C provide the first high-throughput way to overcome the RE-digestion-associated resolution limit of 3C-based methods.\nC_LIO_LIStep-by-step whole-genome and targeted DNase Hi-C protocols for mapping global and local 3D genome architecture, respectively, are described.\nC_LI|10.1016/j.ymeth.2018.01.014|biorxiv

It is widely appreciated that multiple cognitive and reinforcement learning systems contribute to behavior, but the nature of their interactions is elusive. Here, we leverage novel methods for extracting trial-by-trial indices of reinforcement learning (RL) and working memory (WM) in human electroencephalography to reveal single trial computations beyond that afforded by behavior alone. Within-trial dynamics confirmed that increases in neural expectation were predictive of reduced neural surprise in the following feedback period, supporting central tenets of RL models. Cross-trial dynamics revealed a cooperative interplay between systems for learning, in which WM contributes expectations to guide RL, despite competition between systems during choice. Together, these results provide a deeper understanding of how multiple neural systems interact for learning and decision making, and facilitate analysis of their disruption in clinical populations.\n\nOne sentence summaryDecoding of dynamical neural signals in humans reveals cooperation between cognitive and habit learning systems.|10.1073/pnas.1720963115|biorxiv
