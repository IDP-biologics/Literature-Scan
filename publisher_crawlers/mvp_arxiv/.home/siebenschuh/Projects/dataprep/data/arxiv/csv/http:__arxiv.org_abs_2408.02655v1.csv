http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02655v1,Local ergotropy and its fluctuations across a dissipative quantum phase transition,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02655v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/html/2408.02655v1,"We investigate a two-qubit open Rabi model, focusing on local ergotropy - the
maximum extractable work by acting solely on the two qubits - within a
parameter regime where a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dissipative phase
transition occurs. First, we aim to define a protocol for charging, storing,
and discharging the two-qubit system, interpreted as the working principle of
an open quantum battery. Second, we examine the impact of the phase transition
on ergotropy and identify potential markers. To achieve these goals, we
construct an ad-hoc charging unitary operator, leveraging our knowledge of the
ground state near the transition to bring it into a decoherence-free state
during storage. Using advanced numerical techniques based on matrix product
state representation, we reveal that high couplings to an external bath
approximately double the local ergotropy immediately post-charging. Over time
we observe oscillatory behaviors in ergotropy and its fluctuations, which
undergo significant changes near the transition, signaling its occurrence.
Furthermore, we optimize local ergotropy over time using a physically inspired
ansatz, enabling continuous work extraction (local ergotropy never reaches
zero). Our work proposes a tunable, experimentally realizable protocol for work
extraction, leveraging decoherence-free states and phase transitions.
Additionally, it sheds light on the complex interaction between ergotropy and
quantum phase transitions.","10 pages with 5 figures, and 5 appendices with 2 figures",2024-08-05 17:40:43+00:00,2024-08-05 17:40:43+00:00,,quant-ph,,
