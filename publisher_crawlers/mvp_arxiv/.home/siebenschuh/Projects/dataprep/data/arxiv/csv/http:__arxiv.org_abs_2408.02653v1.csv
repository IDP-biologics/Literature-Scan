http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02653v1,Importance of electron-phonon coupling near the electron-liquid to Wigner-crystal transition in two-dimensional atomically thin materials,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02653v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/html/2408.02653v1,"We study the effect of electron-phonon coupling on the location of the Fermi
Liquid to Wigner Crystal transition in the two-dimensional electron gas
realized in various material platforms. Based on dimensional estimates of the
relevant parameters, we conclude that (as conventionally assumed) phonons are
negligible in traditional semiconductor quantum well systems, but likely play a
significant role in various recently synthesized atomically thin
two-dimensional materials.","4 + 4 pages, 2 figures",2024-08-05 17:30:11+00:00,2024-08-05 17:30:11+00:00,,cond-mat.str-el,,
