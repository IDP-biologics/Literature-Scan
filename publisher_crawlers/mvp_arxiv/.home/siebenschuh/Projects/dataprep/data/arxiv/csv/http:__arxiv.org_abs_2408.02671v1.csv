http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02671v1,Systematic bias due to mismodelling precessing binary black hole ringdown,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02671v1.pdf,http://arxiv.org/html/2408.02671v1,"Accurate waveform modelling is crucial for parameter estimation in
gravitational wave astronomy, impacting our understanding of source properties
and the testing of general relativity. The precession of orbital and spin
angular momenta in binary black hole (BBH) systems with misaligned spins
presents a complex challenge for gravitational waveform modelling. Current
precessing BBH waveform models employ a co-precessing frame, which precesses
along with the binary. In this paper, we investigate a source of bias stemming
from the mismodelling of ringdown frequency in the co-precessing frame. We find
that this mismodelling of the co-precessing frame ringdown frequency introduces
systematic biases in parameter estimation, for high mass systems in particular,
and in the Inspiral-Merger-Ringdown (IMR)-consistency test of general
relativity. Employing the waveform model IMRPhenomXPHM, we conduct an
IMR-consistency test using a Fisher matrix analysis across parameter space, as
well as full injected signal parameter estimation studies. Our results show
that this mismodelling particularly affects BBH systems with high mass ratios,
high spin magnitudes, and highly inclined spins. These findings suggest
inconsistencies for all waveform models which do not address this issue.","16 pages, 5 figures",2024-08-05 17:59:45+00:00,2024-08-05 17:59:45+00:00,,gr-qc,,
